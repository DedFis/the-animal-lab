Aardvark,105-130,40-65,Grey,20-30,Insectivore,"Savannas, Grasslands","Lions, Hyenas",40,Africa,Least Concern,Orycteropodidae,210-240,40,Solitary,1,"Aardvarks (Orycteropus afer) are medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammals native to Africa. They have a long snout, similar to that of a pig, which is used to sniff out food. Aardvarks are the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. They are afrotheres, a clade that also includes elephants, manatees, and hyraxes. They are found over much of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. Nocturnal feeders, aardvarks subsist on ants and termites by using their sharp claws and powerful legs to dig the insects out of their hills. Aardvarks also dig to create burrows in which to live and rear their young. Aardvarks are listed as ""least concern"" by the IUCN, although their numbers are decreasing.

The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade, it appears at times to be plantigrade. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles. A contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB). The stress and strain resistance provided by CCCB allows aardvarks to create their burrows, ultimately leading to a favourable environment for plants and a variety of animals. Digging is also facilitated by its forearm's unusually stout ulna and radius.

Aardvarks are found in sub-Saharan Africa, where suitable habitat (savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bushland) and food (i.e., ants and termites) is available. They spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day. The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth. They also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging. They have been documented as high as 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) in Ethiopia. They are present throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions including the coastal areas of Namibia, Ivory Coast, and Ghana. They are not found in Madagascar.

Aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity. Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs, hyenas, and pythons. Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet. They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker. They will also dig to escape as they can. Sometimes, when pressed, aardvarks can dig extremely quickly."
Aardwolf,40-50,14-Aug,Yellow-brown,12,Insectivore,"Grasslands, Savannas","Lions, Leopards",24-30,Eastern and Southern Africa,Least Concern,Hyaenidae,90,40,Solitary,05-Feb,"The aardwolf (Proteles cristatus) is an insectivorous hyaenid species, native to East and Southern Africa. Its name means ""earth-wolf"" in Afrikaans and Dutch. It is also called the maanhaar-jackal (Afrikaans for ""mane-jackal""), termite-eating hyena and civet hyena, based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the African civet.

Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals. It eats insects and their larvae, mainly termites; one aardwolf can lap up as many as 300,000 termites during a single night using its long, sticky tongue. The aardwolf's tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites. The aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern Africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. It is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food.

The aardwolf resembles a much smaller and thinner striped hyena, with a more slender muzzle, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back. It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hindquarters and several stripes on its legs. The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip.

The aardwolf is about 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 in) long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) long, and stands about 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in) tall at the shoulders. An adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7–10 kg (15–22 lb), sometimes reaching 15 kg (33 lb). The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about 10 kg (22 lb)) than the eastern version (around 14 kg (31 lb)). This makes the aardwolf the smallest extant member of the Hyaenidae family. The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. The skull is similar in shape to those of other hyenas, though much smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. It still has canines, but unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. Its ears, which are large, are very similar to those of the striped hyena. 

As an aardwolf ages, it will typically lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats. Aardwolves are shy and nocturnal, sleeping in burrows by day. They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat."
African Elephant,270-310,2700-6000,Grey,60-70,Herbivore,"Savannah, Forest","Lions, Hyenas",25,Africa,Vulnerable,Elephantidae,640-660,40,Herd-based,1,"African elephants are members of the genus Loxodonta comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant (L. africana) and the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). Both are social herbivores with grey skin. However, they differ in the size and colour of their tusks as well as the shape and size of their ears and skulls. 

Both species are at a pertinent risk of extinction according to the IUCN Red List; as of 2021, the bush elephant is considered endangered while the forest elephant is considered critically endangered. They are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, along with poaching for the illegal ivory trade in several range countries. Loxodonta is one of two extant genera in the family Elephantidae. The name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of their molar teeth. Fossil remains of Loxodonta species have been found in Africa, spanning from the Late Miocene (from around 7-6 million years ago) onwards.

African elephants are distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit Sahelian scrubland and arid regions, tropical rainforests, mopane and miombo woodlands. African forest elephant populations occur only in Central and West Africa.

African elephants have grey folded skin up to 30 mm (1.2 in) thick that is covered with sparse, bristled dark-brown to black hair. Short tactile hair grows on the trunk, which has two finger-like processes at the tip, whereas Asian elephants only have one. Their large ears help to reduce body heat. Flapping them creates air currents and exposes the ears' inner sides where large blood vessels increase heat loss during hot weather. The trunk is a prehensile elongation of its upper lip and nose. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the trigeminal nerve, and is thought to be manipulated by about 40,000–60,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure, the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it to lift about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking. Elephants sometimes swim underwater and use their trunks as snorkels.

Elephants are the animals with the lowest sleep times, especially African elephants. Research has found their average sleep to be only 2 hours in 24-hour cycles. Both African elephant species live in family units comprising several adult cows, their daughters and their subadult sons. Each family unit is led by an older cow known as the matriarch. African forest elephant groups are less cohesive than African bush elephant groups, probably because of the lack of predators. 

When separate family units bond, they form kinship or bond groups. After puberty, male elephants tend to form close alliances with other males. While females are the most active members of African elephant groups, both male and female elephants are capable of distinguishing between hundreds of different low-frequency infrasonic calls to communicate with and identify each other. Elephants use some vocalisations that are beyond the hearing range of humans, to communicate across large distances. Elephant mating rituals include the gentle entwining of trunks."
African Lion,80-110,120-250,Tan,14,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Savannas","Hyenas, Crocodiles",58,Africa,Vulnerable,Felidae,98-105,80,Group-based,2-4 (usually),"The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.

The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a ""pride"". Groups of male lions are called ""coalitions"". Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. The majority of females remain in their birth prides while all males and some females will disperse. The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male. Prides act as fission–fusion societies, and members will split into subgroups that keep in contact with roars."
African Wild Dog,75-80,18-36,Multicolored,12,Carnivore,Savannahs,"Lions, Hyenas",56,Sub-Saharan Africa,Endangered,Canidae,70,56,Group-based,12-Oct,"The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), also known as the painted dog or Cape hunting dog, is a wild canine native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the largest wild canine in Africa, and the only extant member of the genus Lycaon, which is distinguished from Canis by dentition highly specialised for a hypercarnivorous diet and by a lack of dewclaws. It is estimated that there are around 6,600 adults (including 1,400 mature individuals) living in 39 subpopulations, all threatened by habitat fragmentation, human persecution and outbreaks of disease. As the largest subpopulation probably consists of fewer than 250 individuals, the African wild dog has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1990.

The species is a specialised diurnal hunter of terrestrial ungulates, which it captures by using its stamina and cooperative hunting to exhaust them. Its natural competitors are lions and spotted hyenas: the former will kill the dogs where possible whilst the latter are frequent kleptoparasites. Like other canids, the African wild dog regurgitates food for its young but also extends this action to adults as a central part of the pack's social unit. The young have the privilege of feeding first on carcasses. The African wild dog has been revered in several hunter-gatherer societies, particularly those of the San people and Prehistoric Egypt.

The African wild dog have strong social bonds, stronger than those of sympatric lions and spotted hyenas; thus, solitary living and hunting are extremely rare in the species. It lives in permanent packs consisting of two to 27 adults and yearling pups. The typical pack size in the Kruger National Park and the Maasai Mara is four or five adults, while packs in Moremi and Selous Game Reserves contain eight or nine. However, larger packs have been observed and temporary aggregations of hundreds of individuals may have gathered in response to the seasonal migration of vast springbok herds in Southern Africa. Males and females have separate dominance hierarchies, with the latter usually being led by the oldest female. Males may be led by the oldest male, but these can be supplanted by younger specimens; thus, some packs may contain elderly male former pack leaders. The dominant pair typically monopolises breeding. 

The species differs from most other social carnivorans in that males remain in the natal pack, while females disperse (a pattern also found in primates such as gorillas, chimpanzees, and red colobuses). Furthermore, males in any given pack tend to outnumber females 3:1. Dispersing females join other packs and evict some of the resident females related to the other pack members, thus preventing inbreeding and allowing the evicted individuals to find new packs of their own and breed. Males rarely disperse, and when they do, they are invariably rejected by other packs already containing males. Although arguably the most social canid, the species lacks the elaborate facial expressions and body language found in the gray wolf, likely because of the African wild dog's less hierarchical social structure. Furthermore, while elaborate facial expressions are important for wolves in re-establishing bonds after long periods of separation from their family groups, they are not as necessary to African wild dogs, which remain together for much longer periods. The species does have an extensive vocal repertoire consisting of twittering, whining, yelping, squealing, whispering, barking, growling, gurling, rumbling, moaning and hooing.

Alpine Ibex,67-101,19-120,Brown,15-20,Herbivore,"Mountains, Alpine","Wolves, Golden Eagles",56-64,European Alps,Least Concern,Bovidae,150,56-64,Group-based,1,"The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), also known as the steinbock, is a European species of goat that lives in the Alps. It is one of ten species in the genus Capra and its closest living relative is the Iberian ibex. The Alpine ibex is a sexually dimorphic species; males are larger and carry longer horns than females. Its coat is brownish-grey. Alpine ibexes tend to live in steep, rough terrain and open alpine meadows. They can be found at elevations as high as 3,300 m (10,800 ft) and their sharp hooves allow them to scale the steep slopes and cliffs of their mountainous habitat.

Alpine ibexes primarily feed on grass and are active throughout the year. Although they are social animals, adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. During the breeding season, males use their long horns to fight for access to females. Ibexes have few predators but may succumb to parasites and diseases.

By the 19th century, the Alpine ibex had been extirpated from most of its range and it went through a population bottleneck of fewer than 100 individuals during its near-extinction event, leading to very low genetic diversity across populations. The species has been successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range. All individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy. As of 2020, the IUCN lists the species as being of least concern.

The Alpine ibex is native to the Alps of central Europe; its range includes France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Germany, and Austria.[9] Fossils of the species have been found as far south as Greece, where it became locally extinct over 7,500 years ago due to human predation.[10] Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the species disappeared from much of its range due to hunting, leaving by the 19th century one surviving population in and around Gran Paradiso, Italy. The species has since been reintroduced into parts of its former range,[9] as well as new areas such as Slovenia[11] and Bulgaria.[9]

The Alpine Ibex is an excellent climber; it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of 1,800 to 3,300 m (5,900 to 10,800 ft). It prefers to live in open areas, but when there is little snow and depending on population density, adult males may gather in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland. Outside the breeding season, the sexes live in separate habitats. Females are more likely to be found on steep slopes while males prefer more level ground. Males inhabit lowland meadows during the spring, when fresh grass appears, and climb to alpine meadows during the summer. In early winter, both males and females move to steep, rocky slopes to avoid dense buildups of snow. Alpine ibexes prefer slopes of 30–45°, and take refuge in small caves and overhangs."
Amazon Rainforest Frog,13-Feb,Up to 0.5,Various,17,Insectivore,Amazon Rainforest,"Birds, Snakes",0.1-1,Amazon Rainforest,Not Evaluated,Dendrobatidae,15-Oct,0.8,Solitary,Up to 40,"Frogs are overwhelmingly the most abundant amphibians in the rainforest. 

More than 1000 species of frogs are found in the Amazon Basin. Unlike temperate frogs which are mostly limited to habitats near water, tropical frogs are most abundant in the trees and relatively few are found near bodies of water on the forest floor. The reason for this occurrence is quite simple: frogs must always keep their skin moist since almost half of their respiration in carried out through their skin. The high humidity of the rainforest and frequent rainstorms gives tropical frogs infinitely more freedom to move into the trees and escape the many predators of rainforest waters. The differences between temperate and tropical frogs extend beyond their habitat. Whereas nearly all temperate frogs lay their eggs in water, the majority of rainforest species place eggs in vegetation or lay them in the ground. By leaving the water, frogs avoid egg-predators like fish, shrimp, aquatic insects, and insect larvae.

Some of rainforest amphibians are
Poison Dart Frogs: Poison Dart Frogs are an especially iconic group of frogs found in the Amazon. These brightly-colored creatures are very tiny (1-2 inches) and are poisonous enough to kill all sorts of large animals, including humans! Their bold colors warn predators not to eat them.

Tree Frogs: There are many species of tree frogs that live in the Amazon. Sticky pads on their feet help them cling to leaves and branches.

Glass Frogs: Another very small type of frog, glass frogs have translucent skin, through which their internal organs are visible. They live mainly in the rivers and streams of cloud forests. 

Cane Toad: Many types of toads also live in the Amazon, including the Cane Toad, which is a giant toad that can be 6 inches long. It is toxic, and a voracious insect eater. It gets its name because it was brought to sugarcane fields in North America and Australia to control pest populations. While it’s a part of healthy ecosystems in the Amazon, it’s actually a harmful invasive species in some of the places it was introduced .

Smooth-sided Toad: Smooth-Sided Toads are another kind of toxic toad. Like the Cane Toad, they are also very large. Unlike many toads, their skin is smooth. They like to live in leaf litter and rock piles

These are only a very small sample of the huge variety of frogs and toads that live in the Amazon! Because of their permeable skin, they are especially sensitive to changes in their habitat and climate . This means that as deforestation and climate change affect more and more of the Amazon, these incredible creatures are extremely at risk of extinction."
American Bison,152-186,"318-1,000",Brown,15-20,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Plains","Wolves, Grizzly Bears",40-56,North America,Near Threatened,Bovidae,270-290,56,Group-based,1,"The American bison (Bison bison), commonly known as the American buffalo, or simply buffalo (not to be confused with true buffalo), is a species of bison that is endemic (or native) to North America. It is one of two extant species of bison, along with the European bison. Its historical range circa 9000 BC is referred to as the great bison belt, a tract of rich grassland spanning from Alaska south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas), as far north as New York, south to Georgia, and according to some sources, further south to northern Florida, with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.

Two subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (B. b. bison), smaller and with a more rounded hump; and the wood bison (B. b. athabascae), the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump. Furthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains (B. b. montanae) and a southern plains (B. b. bison) subspecies, bringing the total to three. However, this is generally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of extant bovid in the world, surpassed only by the Asian gaur. Among extant land animals in North America, the bison is the heaviest and the longest, and the second tallest after the moose.

Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle. With an estimated population of 60 million in the late 18th century, the species was culled down to just 541 animals by 1889 as part of the subjugation of the Native Americans, because the American bison was a major resource for their traditional way of life (food source, hides for clothing and shelter, and horns and bones for tools). Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century, with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 wild bison as of March 2019. For many years, the population was primarily found in a few national parks and reserves. Through multiple reintroductions, the species now freely roams wild in several regions in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The American bison has also been introduced to Yakutia in Russia.

Spanning back millennia, Native American tribes have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison. It is the national mammal of the United States. Population estimates in 2010 ranged from 400,000 to 500,000, with approximately 20,500 animals in 62 conservation herds and the remainder in approximately 6,400 commercial herds.[49][50] According to the IUCN, roughly 15,000 bison are considered wild, free-range bison not primarily confined by fencing.

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has reintroduced bison to over a dozen nature preserves around the United States. In October 2016, TNC established its easternmost bison herd in the country, at Kankakee Sands nature preserve in Morocco, Newton County, Indiana. In 2014, U.S. Tribes and Canadian First Nations signed a treaty to help with the restoration of bison, the first to be signed in nearly 150 years.

Anteater,52-91,22-41,"Brown, White",15-20,Insectivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Jaguars, Pumas",24,Central and South America,Least Concern,Myrmecophagidae,190-210,24,Solitary,1,"Anteaters are the four extant mammal species in the suborder Vermilingua (meaning ""worm tongue""), commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name ""anteater"" is also commonly applied to the aardvark, numbat, echidnas, and pangolins, although they are not closely related to them.

Extant species are the giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla, about 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) long including the tail; the silky anteater Cyclopes didactylus, about 35 cm (14 in) long; the southern tamandua or collared anteater Tamandua tetradactyla, about 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) long; and the northern tamandua Tamandua mexicana of similar dimensions.

All anteaters have extremely elongated snouts equipped with a thin and long tongue that is coated with sticky saliva produced by enlarged submaxillary glands. The mouth is small and has no teeth. The frontal feet have large claws on the third digit, used to break into the mounds of termites and ants, and the remaining digits are usually slightly smaller or lacking entirely. The entire body is covered with dense fur. The tail is long, in some cases as long as the rest of the body, covered with varying amounts of fur, and prehensile in all species except for the giant anteater. Anteaters are known to experience color abnormalities, including albinism in giant anteaters and albinism, leucism, and melanism in the southern tamandua.

Anteaters are mostly solitary mammals prepared to defend their 1.0 to 1.5 sq mi (2.6 to 3.9 km2) territories. They do not normally enter a territory of another anteater of the same sex, but males often enter the territory of associated females. When a territorial dispute occurs, they vocalize, swat, and can sometimes sit on or even ride the back of their opponents. Anteaters have poor sight but an excellent sense of smell, and most species depend on the latter for foraging, feeding, and defence. Their hearing is thought to be good.

With a body temperature fluctuating between 33 and 36 °C (91 and 97 °F), anteaters, like other xenarthrans, have among the lowest body temperatures of any mammal, and can tolerate greater fluctuations in body temperature than most mammals. Their daily energy intake from food is only slightly greater than their energy need for daily activities, and anteaters probably coordinate their body temperatures so they keep cool during periods of rest, and heat up during foraging.

Anteater habitats include dry tropical forests, rainforests, grasslands, and savannas. The silky anteater is specialized to an arboreal environment, but the more opportunistic tamanduas find their food both on the ground and in trees, typically in dry forests near streams and lakes. The almost entirely terrestrial giant anteater lives in savannas. The two anteaters of the genus Tamandua, the southern and the northern tamanduas are much smaller than the giant anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests of South and Central America. The silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) is a native of the hottest parts of South and Central America and exclusively arboreal in its habits."
Arabian Horse,140-160,380-1000,Various,25-30,Herbivore,"Middle East, North Africa","Humans, Predators",65,"Middle East, North Africa",Not Applicable,Equidae,330-342,65,Herd-based,1,"The Arabian or Arab horse is a breed of horse with historic roots on the Arabian Peninsula. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. It is also one of the oldest modern breeds. Although modern DNA cannot trace breed purity in the modern population beyond 200 years, there is archaeological evidence of horses in the Middle East with landrace characteristics that resemble modern Arabians dating back 3,500 years. Throughout history, Arabian horses have spread around the world by both war and trade, used to improve other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and strong bone. Today, Arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse.

The Arabian developed in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits, including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans, created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.

Arabians are thought to be one of the oldest human-developed horse breeds in the world. Recent genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA in Arabian horses of Polish and American breeding suggest that the modern breed has heterogeneous origins with ten haplogroups. The modern concept of breed purity in the modern population cannot be traced beyond 200 years.

For centuries, Arabian horses lived in the desert in close association with humans. For shelter and protection from theft, prized war mares were sometimes kept in their owner's tent, close to children and everyday family life. Only horses with a naturally good disposition were allowed to reproduce, with the result that Arabians today have a good temperament that, among other examples, makes them one of the few breeds where the United States Equestrian Federation rules allow children to exhibit stallions in nearly all show ring classes, including those limited to riders under 18.

Arabians are versatile horses that compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, as well as dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses for those who are not interested in competition. They are one of the top ten most popular horse breeds in the world. They are now found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East.

Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave, or ""dished"" profile. Many Arabians also have a slight forehead bulge between their eyes, called the jibbah by the Bedouin, that adds additional sinus capacity, believed to have helped the Arabian horse in its native dry desert climate. Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a refined, clean throatlatch. This structure of the poll and throatlatch was called the mitbah or mitbeh by the Bedouin. In the ideal Arabian, it is long, allowing flexibility in the bridle and room for the windpipe."

It is a bovid, and the smallest member of the genus Oryx, native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s, but was saved in zoos and private reserves, and was reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980.

In 1986, the Arabian oryx was classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List, and in 2011, it was the first animal to revert to vulnerable status after previously being listed as extinct in the wild. It is listed in CITES Appendix I. In 2016, populations were estimated at 1,220 individuals in the wild, including 850 mature individuals, and 6,000–7,000 in captivity worldwide.

The Arabian oryx' coat is an almost luminous white, the undersides and legs are brown, and black stripes occur where the head meets the neck, on the forehead, on the nose, and going from the horn down across the eye to the mouth. Both sexes have long, straight or slightly curved, ringed horns which are 0.61–1.49 m (2–4.9 ft). It stands between 0.79 and 1.25 m (2.6 and 4.1 ft) tall at the shoulder and typically weighs between 220 to 460 lb (100 to 209 kg).

Arabian oryxes prefer to range in gravel deserts or hard sand, where their speed and endurance will protect them from most predators and hunters on foot. In the sand deserts in Saudi Arabia, they used to be found in the hard sand areas of the flats between the softer dunes and ridges. Arabian oryxes have been reintroduced to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, and Jordan. A small population was introduced on Hawar Island, Bahrain, and large semi-managed populations at several sites in Qatar and the UAE. The total reintroduced population is now estimated to be around 1,000. This puts the Arabian oryx well over the threshold of 250 mature individuals needed to qualify for endangered status. However, the majority of the population is concentrated in Saudi Arabia.

Arabian oryxes rest during the heat of the day. They can detect rainfall and move towards it, meaning they have huge ranges; a herd in Oman can range over 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi). Packs are of mixed sex and usually contain between 2 and 15 animals, though herds of up to 100 have been reported. Arabian oryxes are generally not aggressive toward one another, which allows herds to exist peacefully for some time. The diets of the Arabian oryx consist mainly of grasses, but they eat a large variety of vegetation, including buds, herbs, fruit, tubers and roots. Herds of Arabian oryxes follow infrequent rains to eat the new plants that grow afterwards. They can go for several weeks without water. In Oman, it primarily eats grasses of the genus Stipagrostis, flowers from Stipagrostis plants appeared highest in crude protein and water, while leaves seemed a better food source with other vegetation."
Arctic Fox,25-30,2.5-9,White,6,Omnivore,Tundra,Polar Bears,60,Arctic regions,Least Concern,Canidae,52-60,60,Solitary,11-Apr,"The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small species of fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years. Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat.

The Arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings, voles, ringed seal pups, fish, waterfowl, and seabirds. It also eats carrion, berries, seaweed, and insects and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young. Natural predators of the Arctic fox are golden eagles, Arctic wolves, polar bears, wolverines, red foxes, and grizzly bears.

Arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90–100 °C (160–180 °F) between the external environment and their internal core temperature. To prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail. This position gives the fox the smallest surface area to volume ratio and protects the least insulated areas. Arctic foxes also stay warm by getting out of the wind and residing in their dens. Although the Arctic foxes are active year-round and do not hibernate, they attempt to preserve fat by reducing their locomotor activity. They build up their fat reserves in the autumn, sometimes increasing their body weight by more than 50%. This provides greater insulation during the winter and a source of energy when food is scarce.

The Arctic fox has a circumpolar distribution and occurs in Arctic tundra habitats in northern Europe, northern Asia, and North America. Its range includes Greenland, Iceland, Fennoscandia, Svalbard, Jan Mayen (where it was hunted to extinction) and other islands in the Barents Sea, northern Russia, islands in the Bering Sea, Alaska, and Canada as far south as Hudson Bay. In the late 19th century, it was introduced into the Aleutian Islands southwest of Alaska. However, the population on the Aleutian Islands is currently being eradicated in conservation efforts to preserve the local bird population. It mostly inhabits tundra and pack ice, but is also present in Canadian boreal forests (northeastern Alberta, northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, Northern Ontario, Northern Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador) and the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. They are found at elevations up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level and have been seen on sea ice close to the North Pole."
Arowana,Up to 120,Up to 6.7,"Silver, Gold, Green",20,"Carnivore, Piscivore","Freshwater Rivers, Lakes","Birds, Larger Fish",16-32,"South America, Asia",Not Evaluated,Osteoglossidae,Not Applicable,32,Solitary,Not Applicable,"Arowanas are freshwater bony fish of the subfamily Osteoglossinae, also known as bony tongues (the latter name is now often reserved for Arapaiminae). In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name ""bonytongues"" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the ""tongue"", equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue.

Osteoglossids are carnivorous, often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; Osteoglossum species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname ""water monkeys"". Arowana species typically grow to around 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) in captivity. Arowanas can be troublesome to keep as pets. They are expensive, require wide living space, are picky eaters, and need a lot of care. Arowanas are renowned for their aggressive behavior and personality.

Several species of osteoglossids exhibit parental care. They build nests and protect their young after they hatch. All species are mouthbrooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently. Unlike most fishes that start reproducing at around six months of age, the arowana usually takes three to four years to reach sexual maturity.

Depending on the classification system used, there are ten types of arowana commonly kept as pets: four from Asia, three from South America, two from Australia, and one from Africa. Asian arowana is an endangered species and banned in the United States. It is a status symbol among wealthy Asian men. An albino arowana sold for a record price of $300,000 in 2009. Most pet arowana are farmed behind high-security fences.

Arowanas are solitary fish and only allow company while young; adults may show dominance and aggression. Some compatible species often partnered with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gar, tinfoil barb, Siamese tigerfish, and any other somewhat aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana's mouth. These fish are best kept with live or frozen feed and they easily outgrow the tank within eight to ten months. An aquarium with the minimum diameter of 6 by 3.5 feet (1.8 by 1.1 m) and 300 US gallons (1,100 L; 250 imp gal) is suggested as a bare minimum but 400–800 US gallons (1,500–3,000 L; 330–670 imp gal) is the best way to go. Australian species are best kept alone in aquaria. It is estimated that the total annual revenue of the Asian arowana sector was over US$200 million globally since 2012."
Asian Elephant,200-300,2000-5000,Grey,60-80,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Tigers, Leopards",40,Asia (Southeast),Endangered,Elephantidae,640-660,40,Herd-based,1,"The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is a species of elephant distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west to Borneo in the east, and Nepal in the north to Sumatra in the south. Three subspecies are recognised—E. m. maximus, E. m. indicus and E. m. sumatranus. The Asian elephant is characterised by its long trunk with a single finger-like processing; large tusks in males; laterally folded large ears but smaller in contrast to African elephants; and wrinkled grey skin. The skin is smoother than African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears or neck. Adult males average 4 tonnes (4.4 short tons) in weight, and females 2.7 t (3.0 short tons).

It is one of only three living species of elephants or elephantids anywhere in the world, the others being the African bush elephant and African forest elephant. Further, the Asian elephant is the only living species of the genus Elephas. It is the second largest species of elephant after the African bush elephant. It frequently inhabits grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests. They are herbivorous, eating about 150 kg (330 lb) of vegetation per day. Cows and calves form groups, while males remain solitary or form ""bachelor groups"" with other males. During the breeding season, males will temporarily join female groups to mate. Asian elephants have a large and well-developed neocortex of the brain, are highly intelligent and self-aware being able to display behaviors associated grief, learning, greeting etc.

The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia. Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 per cent over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching. Wild Asian elephants live to be about 60 years old. While female captive elephants are recorded to have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, Asian elephants die at a much younger age in captivity; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate. The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium BC.

Asian elephants are distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, to Borneo in the east, and Nepal in the north, to Sumatra in the south. They inhabit grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants occur from sea level to over 3,000 m (9,800 ft). 

As of 2017, the estimated wild population in India account for nearly three-fourths of the extant population, at 27,312 individuals. As of 2019, the global wild population was estimated at 48,323–51,680 individuals."
Atlantic Puffin,25-30,500-620,"Black, White",20-25,"Carnivore, Piscivore","North Atlantic, Arctic","Gulls, Birds of Prey",30-50,"North Atlantic, Arctic",Vulnerable,Alcidae,40,80,Colony-based,1,"The Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), also known as the common puffin, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is the only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted puffin and the horned puffin being found in the northeastern Pacific. The Atlantic puffin breeds in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, Britain, Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and the Faroe Islands, and as far south as Maine in the west and France in the east. It is most commonly found in the Westman Islands, Iceland. Although it has a large population and a wide range, the species has declined rapidly, at least in parts of its range, resulting in it being rated as vulnerable by the IUCN. On land, it has the typical upright stance of an auk. At sea, it swims on the surface and feeds on zooplankton, small fish, and crabs, which it catches by diving underwater, using its wings for propulsion.

This puffin has a black crown and back, pale grey cheek patches, and a white body and underparts. Its broad, boldly marked red-and-black beak and orange legs contrast with its plumage. It moults while at sea in the winter, and some of the brightly coloured facial characteristics are lost, with colour returning during the spring. The external appearances of the adult male and female are identical, though the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage, but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is narrower and is dark grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than in the south and these populations are generally considered a different subspecies.

Spending the autumn and winter in the open ocean of the cold northern seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas at the start of the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. Chicks mostly feed on whole fish and grow rapidly. After about 6 weeks, they are fully fledged and make their way at night to the sea. They swim away from the shore and do not return to land for several years.

Colonies are mostly on islands with no terrestrial predators, but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes, a bird such as an Arctic skua or blackback gull can cause a puffin arriving with a beak full of fish to drop all the fish the puffin was holding in its mouth. The puffin's striking appearance, large, colourful bill, waddling gait, and behaviour have given rise to nicknames such as ""clown of the sea"" or ""sea parrot"". It is the official bird of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador."
Atlantic Spotted Dolphin,200-250,120-140,"Gray, White",20-25,Carnivore,"Oceans, Coastal Areas","Sharks, Orcas",40-64,Worldwide,Least Concern,Delphinidae,360-380,40-64,Group-based,1,"The Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) is a dolphin found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Older members of the species have a very distinctive spotted coloration all over their bodies. Atlantic spotted dolphins are found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. They usually form groups of five to 50 individuals but sometimes travel in groups of up to 200. They are fast swimmers and often “surf” in the waves created by vessels.

Young Atlantic spotted dolphins do not have spots. As a result, they can look like slender bottlenose dolphins. Their distinctive spotted pattern starts to appear all over their bodies as they get older. Atlantic spotted dolphins, like all marine mammals, are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

The coloring of the Atlantic spotted dolphin varies enormously as it grows, and is usually classified into age-dependent phases known as two-tone, speckled, mottled, and fused. Calves are a fairly uniform gray-white, with one or no spots. When they are weaned, speckling occurs, typically between 3 and 4 years and lasting for an average of 5 years. A juvenile is considered mottled when it develops merging gray and white spots on the dorsal surface and black spots on the ventral surface. This usually happens between age 8 or 9. A fused pattern is reached when dark and white spots are on both the ventral and dorsal sides. As the animal matures, the spots become denser and spread until the body appears black with white spots at full maturation.

Atlantic spotted dolphins are extremely gregarious animals, which gather in complex social groups of 5–15, often in mixed groups with common bottlenose dolphins. They are fast swimmers and known for their bow-riding and long, shallow leaping behaviors. Their mating system consists of one male mating with several females, and the pod is highly protective over pregnant females. The dolphin's gestational period is ~11 months, and the mother cares for its calf for up to 5 years, with the help of the rest of her group. 

These animals are cooperative hunters that hunt in groups at night. They strategically encircle their prey, which consists mostly of small fish, benthic invertebrates, and cephalopods such as squid. They can dive to depths of up to 60 m (200 ft) and can stay beneath the surface for up to 10 minutes at a time. When showing aggression towards other species, these dolphins make use of more contact behaviors such as biting and chasing than when being aggressive towards members of their species, in which they usually rely on display behaviors.

The species is endemic to the temperate and tropical areas of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been widely observed in the western end of the Gulf Stream, between Florida and Bermuda. Off the Bahamas, tourism industries to swim with dolphins are available. It is also present in the Gulf of Mexico. More infrequent sightings have been made further east, off the Azores and Canary Islands. Northerly sightings have been made as far north as Cape Cod across to the southwestern tip of Spain. They are certainly present further south, too, as far as Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and across to west Africa, but their distribution is poorly understood in these areas."
Australian Fur Seal,112-160,18-40,"Brown, Gray",14-17,Carnivore,Coastal Waters,"Sharks, Orcas",24-40,"Australia, New Zealand",Least Concern,Otariidae,300-350,24-40,Group-based,1,"The Australian fur seal is the largest of eight species of fur seal in the world. They have two layers of fur, a longer outer layer of guard hairs and a fine underfur for warmth.  All seals belong to a group of mammals called pinnipeds. Fur seals are otariids (eared seals) that have tiny ears and use both pairs of flippers when ‘walking’ on land, unlike phocids (true seals), which have internal ears and can’t use their rear flippers for ‘walking’.  Although they can breathe on land, Australian fur seals prefer to live in the water and spend weeks feeding at sea. As you can imagine, they’re very good swimmers!

Fur seals have large eyes, a pointed face with whiskers and sharp teeth. The Australian Fur Seal, Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus is the largest of all the fur seals. It has a broad head, pointed snout and long backward sweeping facial vibrissae (whiskers). The body is robust and covered in thick brown layered hair except on the front and back flippers. The Australian Fur Seal is sexually dimorphic (males and females are visibly different). The males are larger than the females and when mature carry a dark mane of coarse hair. They have a set of carnivore-like teeth similar to those of a large dog or bear. Like all members of the Family Otariidae (Fur seals and sea lions) they can raise their body onto their front flippers to move around on land.

Australian Fur Seals frequent coastal waters and oceans. Their preferred habitat especially for breeding is rocky islands, which include boulder or pebble beaches and gradually sloping rocky ledges. The Australian Fur Seal has a relatively restricted distribution around the islands of Bass Strait, parts of Tasmania and southern Victoria. They can be seen hauling out (coming ashore) on islands off South Australia and areas of southern New South Wales such as Montague Island with the occasional animal appearing as far north as the mid north coast of New South Wales.

As it is closely related to the South African Fur Seal, its populations worldwide are reasonable secure although it is occasionally commercially hunted in South Africa. In Australia it is fully protected although its numbers are probably still only half those of the historic pre sealing days. It continues to be vulnerable to disturbance at its breeding sites and suffers some loses as a result of conflict with commercial fishing operations.

Australian Fur Seals feed on a variety of bony fish species plus squid and octopus. They are voracious and skilful hunters in the water and are not adverse to taking advantage of situations where fish are corralled by nets and fish farms. With its streamlined shape and strong flippers, the Australian Fur Seal is an agile swimmer and can dive to depths of 200 m to catch fishes and squids. Despite its cumbersome appearance, it is also quite mobile on land, even over rocky terrain. Fur seals differ from other seals (true seals) because they have external ears and the ability to use all four limbs to move across land. Also, fur seals have two layers of fur while other seals have only one layer."
Axolotl,Up to 30,Up to 300,Various,15,Carnivore,"Lakes, Canals","Fish, Birds",0.8,Mexico,Critically Endangered,Ambystomatidae,14-21,0.2-0.3,Solitary,100-300,"The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a paedomorphic salamander closely related to the tiger salamander. It is unusual among amphibians in that it reaches adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and gilled. The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now Mexico City, such as Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco. These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, leading to the destruction of much of the axolotl's natural habitat.

As of 2020, the axolotl was near extinction due to urbanization in Mexico City and consequent water pollution, as well as the introduction of invasive species such as tilapia and perch. It is listed as critically endangered in the wild, with a decreasing population of around 50 to 1,000 adult individuals, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Axolotls are used extensively in scientific research due to their ability to regenerate limbs, gills and parts of their eyes and brains. Notably, their ability to regenerate declines with age, but it does not disappear. Axolotls keep modestly growing throughout their life and some consider this trait to be a direct contributor to their regenerative abilities. Further research has been conducted to examine their heart as a model of human single ventricle and excessive trabeculation. Axolotls were also sold as food in Mexican markets and were a staple in the Aztec diet.

Axolotls may be confused with the larval stage of the closely related tiger salamander (A. tigrinum), which are widespread in much of North America and occasionally become paedomorphic, or with mudpuppies (Necturus spp.), fully aquatic salamanders from a different family that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance. The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as mollusks, worms, insects, other arthropods, and small fish in the wild. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will ""snap"" at any potential meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force.

The axolotl is a popular exotic pet like its relative, the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). As for all poikilothermic organisms, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism and a very unhealthily reduced appetite. Temperatures at approximately 16 °C (61 °F) to 18 °C (64 °F) are suggested for captive axolotls to ensure sufficient food intake; stress resulting from more than a day's exposure to lower temperatures may quickly lead to disease and death, and temperatures higher than 24 °C (75 °F) may lead to metabolic rate increase, also causing stress and eventually death. Chlorine, commonly added to tapwater, is harmful to axolotls.

 A single axolotl typically requires a 150-litre (40-US-gallon) tank. Axolotls spend the majority of the time at the bottom of the tank. Salts, such as Holtfreter's solution, are often added to the water to prevent infection. In captivity, axolotls eat a variety of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live bloodworms, earthworms, and waxworms. Axolotls can also eat feeder fish, but care should be taken as fish may contain parasites."
Aye-Aye,35-37,2.2-2.7,"Black, Brown",20-23,"Omnivore, Insectivore",Rainforests,Birds of Prey,32,Madagascar,Endangered,Daubentoniidae,160-170,32,Solitary,1,"The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is a long-fingered lemur, a strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar with rodent-like teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger that they can use to catch grubs and larvae out of tree trunks.

It is the world's largest nocturnal primate. It is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called percussive foraging, and takes up 5–41% of foraging time. The only other living mammal species known to find food in this way are the striped possum and trioks (genus Dactylopsila) of northern Australia and New Guinea, which are marsupials. From an ecological point of view, the aye-aye fills the niche of a woodpecker, as it is capable of penetrating wood to extract the invertebrates within.

The aye-aye is the only extant member of the genus Daubentonia and family Daubentoniidae. It is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN. A second species, Daubentonia robusta, appears to have become extinct at some point within the last 1000 years, and is known from subfossil finds. A full-grown aye-aye is typically about 60 centimetres (2 feet) long with a tail longer than its body. The species has an average head and body length of 36–43 cm (14–17 in) plus a tail of 56–61 cm (22–24 in), and weighs around 2 kilograms (4 pounds).

The aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent. The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.

The aye-aye is an omnivore and commonly eats seeds, nuts, fruits, nectar, plant exudates and fungi, but also xylophagous, or wood boring, insect larvae (especially cerambycid beetle larvae) and honey. Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers"
Baird's Tapir,76-107,150-400,"Brown, Black",25-30,Herbivore,"Rainforests, Grasslands","Jaguars, Crocodiles",48,Central and South America,Endangered,Tapiridae,390-395,48,Solitary,1,"The Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), also known as the Central American tapir, is a species of tapir native to Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. It is the largest of the three species of tapir native to the Americas, as well as the largest native land mammal in both Central and South America.

The Baird's tapir is found in many diverse vegetation types. They can withstand elevations from sea level to up to 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). The animal can be found in wet areas like mangrove forests, marshes, swamp areas, and wet tropical rainforests. It also resides in drier areas like riparian woodlands, deciduous forests, and mountainous cloud forests. It prefers secondary growth forests, when available, due to increase in understory plants for foraging and protection. Food and water availability as well as protection are key factors in habitat selection.

The Baird's tapir has a distinctive cream-colored marking on its face, throat, and tips of its ears, with a dark spot on each cheek, behind and below the eye. The rest of its bristly hair is dark brown or grayish brown. The animal is very muscly, and about the size of a small donkey. A long thin mane is present but not always conspicuous. It has two small oval shaped eyes flush with the side of the head. Its ears are large, oval-shaped and not very mobile. Baird's tapirs average 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, but can range between 1.8 and 2.5 m (5 ft 11 in and 8 ft 2 in), not counting a stubby, vestigial tail of 5–13 cm (2.0–5.1 in), and 73–120 cm (29–47 in) in height. Body mass in adults can range from 150 to 300 kg (330 to 660 lb). Like the other species of tapirs, they have small, stubby tails. Their snout and upper lips project forward to create a fleshy and flexible proboscis. This proboscis is their strongest sense organ that aids in finding food and detecting physical stimuli. Their legs are short and slender; well adapted to rapid movement through underbrush. They have four toes on each front foot, and three toes on each back foot.

The Baird's tapir may be active at all hours, but is primarily nocturnal. It forages for leaves and fallen fruit, using well-worn tapir paths which zigzag through the thick undergrowth of the forest. The animal usually stays close to water and enjoys swimming and wading – on especially hot days, individuals will rest in a watering hole for hours with only their heads above water. When in danger, these animals will seek water. It generally leads a solitary life, though small feeding groups are not uncommon, and individuals, especially those of different ages (young with their mothers, juveniles with adults), are often observed together. The animals communicate with one another through shrill whistles and squeaks.

When the Baird's tapir mate, they form long-term monogamous pairs. These pairs are known to defend territory. Though they can breed at any point in the year, it is most common prior to rainy seasons. Both parents take part in raising the children, as they move and sleep together as a unit. The mother will guide young by a nudging movement with her proboscis."

A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years. Bald eagles are not bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, ""white headed"". 

The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.

The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States of America and appears on its seal. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered, and the species's status was upgraded from ""endangered"" to ""threatened"" in 1995, and removed from the list altogether in 2007.

The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on thermal convection currents. It reaches speeds of 56–70 km/h (35–43 mph) when gliding and flapping, and about 48 km/h (30 mph) while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between 120–160 km/h (75–99 mph), though it seldom dives vertically. Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Fish often comprise most of the eagle's diet throughout their range. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. More than 400 species are known to be included in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, far more than its ecological equivalent in the Old World, the white-tailed eagle, is known to take."
Banded Palm Civet,41-71,05-Feb,"Brown, Black, White",10,Omnivore,Forests,Birds of Prey,16,"Southeast Asia, South Asia",Least Concern,Viverridae,60-64,16,Solitary,05-Feb,"The banded palm civet (Hemigalus derbyanus), also called the banded civet, is a viverrid native to Indomalaya. They are believed to be closely related to Hose's palm civets, which are similar in appearance and distribution. The banded palm civet is the only species in its genus, first scientifically described in 1837. The species comprises four subspecies, distributed across Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Two of the subspecies diverged from each other as long ago as 2.7 million years.

The major threat to the banded palm civet is loss and destruction of natural habitat loss by logging and subsequent conversion to agriculture, plantations and construction of dams. It is hunted and eaten by local people in Sabah. Its preferred habitat, lowland forest, is particularly prone to such threats. In 2016, the population was thought to have declined by 30% over just three generations. In 2022, it was estimated that the population has declined to just 21% of the IUCN Red List distribution.

The banded palm civet's fur is usually pale in colour, and they have between seven and eight dark bands on their face and on their back. The pale colour is typically pale brown, grey, whitish or buff, but can also be yellowish; the bands are usually dark brown, black, or chestnut in colour. It is roughly the size of domestic cat, growing up to 53 cm (21 in) in length – minus the tail – and weighing from 1–3 kg (2.2–6.6 lb). The tail is usually three-quarters the length of the body and head combined, and appear to swell in size in response to a threat. It has sensitive hairs in between the pads of its paws for sensing prey.

The banded palm civet is native to Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, the Mentawai Islands and Borneo from sea level up to an elevation of 1,660 m (5,450 ft). The banded palm civet is nocturnal and spends the day in low tree holes. It is thought to be a solitary animal. Its activity pattern overlaps with two other species of civet, rodents, as well as the clouded leopard – a potential predator. In response to a predator or other threat, banded palm civets swell their tails.

The banded palm civet is a strict carnivore and preys on a variety of small animals, including crustaceans, ants, spiders, worms, rats, frogs, small reptiles and birds. It occasionally feeds on vegetation and fruits. Banded palm civets hunt around water or along the forest floor. To attack large prey, the civets bite the back of the victim's neck and then shake vigorously, then hold their victim with their front paws, allowing them to attack with their teeth.

Banded palm civets are affected by a variety of parasites, such as nematodes, and are primarily carnivorous, eating small animals such as rodents and bugs. They have sensitive hairs on their paws which help them to detect potential prey."
Barbary Macaque,Up to 75,13-May,"Brown, Gray",Up to 30,"Herbivore, Omnivore","Forests, Mountains","Leopards, Eagles",30,"Gibraltar, North Africa, Middle East",Endangered,Cercopithecidae,165-200,30,Group-based,1,"The Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), also known as Barbary ape, is a macaque species native to the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, along with a small introduced population in Gibraltar. It is the type species of the genus Macaca. The species is of particular interest because males play an atypical role in rearing young. Because of uncertain paternity, males are integral to raising all infants. Generally, Barbary macaques of both sexes and all ages contribute in alloparental care of young.

The diet of the Barbary macaque consists primarily of plants and insects and they are found in a variety of habitats. Males live to around 25 years old while females may live up to 30 years. Besides humans, they are the only free-living primates in Europe. Although the species is commonly referred to as the ""Barbary ape"", the Barbary macaque is a true monkey. Its name refers to the Barbary Coast of Northwest Africa.

The population of the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar is the only one outside Northern Africa and the only population of wild monkeys in Europe. Barbary macaques were once widely distributed in Europe, as far north as England, from the Early Pliocene (Zanclean) to the Late Pleistocene, as recently as 85-40,000 years ago. About 300 macaques live on the Rock of Gibraltar. This population appears to be stable or increasing, while the North African population is declining.

The Barbary macaque has a dark pink face with a pale buff to golden brown to grey pelage and a lighter underside. The colour of mature adults changes with ages. In adults and subadults the fur on the back is variegated pale and dark which is due to banding on individual hairs. In spring to early summer, as the temperatures rise, the adult macaques moult their thick winter fur. The species shows sexual dimorphism with males larger than females. The mean head-body length is 55.7 cm (21.9 in) in females and 63.4 cm (25.0 in) in males. The boneless vestigial tail is greatly reduced compared with other macaque species and, if not absent, measures 4–22 mm (0.16–0.87 in). Males may have a more prominent tail, though data is scarce. The average body weight is 9.9–11 kg (22–24 lb) in females and 14.5–16 kg (32–35 lb) in males.

The Barbary macaque is gregarious, forming mixed groups of several females and males. Troops can have 10 to 100 individuals and are matriarchal, with their hierarchy determined by lineage to the lead female. Males may spend a considerable amount of time playing with and grooming infants. In this way, a strong social bond is formed between males and juveniles, both the male's own offspring and those of others in the troop. This may be a result of selectivity on the part of the females, who may prefer highly parental males.

The Barbary macaque's main predators are the domestic dog, leopard and eagles; the golden eagle may only prey on cubs, since it is morphologically not adapted to hunt primates. The approach of eagles and domestic dogs is known to elicit an alarm call response."
Basking Shark,Up to 1100,400-700,"Gray, Brown",20-25,Carnivore,Oceans,"Orcas, Great White Sharks",14-28,Worldwide,Vulnerable,Cetorhinidae,36-42 months,14-28,Solitary,04-Feb,"The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is the second-largest living shark and fish, after the whale shark. It is one of three plankton-eating shark species, along with the whale shark and megamouth shark. Typically, basking sharks reach 7.9 m (26 ft) in length. It is usually greyish-brown, with mottled skin, with the inside of the mouth being white in colour. The caudal fin has a strong lateral keel and a crescent shape. Other common names include bone shark, elephant shark, sailfish, and sunfish. In Orkney, it is called hoe-mother (contracted homer), meaning ""the mother of the piked dogfish"".

The basking shark is a cosmopolitan migratory species found in all the world's temperate oceans. A slow-moving filter feeder, its common name derives from its habit of feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water there. It has anatomical adaptations for filter-feeding, such as a greatly enlarged mouth and highly developed gill rakers. Its snout is conical, and the gill slits extend around the top and bottom of its head. The gill rakers, dark and bristle-like, are used to catch plankton as water filters through the mouth and over the gills. The teeth are numerous and very small and often number 100 per row. The teeth have a single conical cusp, are curved backwards and are the same on both the upper and lower jaws. This species has the smallest weight-for-weight brain size of any shark, reflecting its relatively passive lifestyle.

Basking sharks have been shown from satellite tracking to overwinter in both continental shelf (less than 200 m or 660 ft) and deeper waters. They may be found in either small shoals or alone. Despite their large size and threatening appearance, basking sharks are not aggressive and are harmless to humans. The basking shark has long been a commercially important fish as a source of food, shark fin, animal feed, and shark liver oil. Overexploitation has reduced its populations to the point where some have disappeared and others need protection.

The basking shark is a coastal-pelagic shark found worldwide in boreal to warm-temperate waters. It lives around the continental shelf and occasionally enters brackish waters. It is found from the surface down to at least 910 m (2,990 ft). It prefers temperatures of 8 to 14.5 °C (46.4 to 58.1 °F) but has been confirmed to cross the much warmer waters at the equator. It is often seen close to land, including in bays with narrow openings. The shark follows plankton concentrations in the water column, so it is often visible at the surface. It characteristically migrates with the seasons. Basking sharks do not hibernate and are active year-round. In winter, basking sharks often move to deeper depths, even down to 900 m (3,000 ft) and have been tracked making vertical movements consistent with feeding on overwintering zooplankton.

As a result of rapidly declining numbers, the basking shark has been protected in some territorial waters and trade in its products is restricted in many countries under CITES. Among others, it is fully protected in the United Kingdom and the Atlantic and Mexican Gulf regions of the United States."
Bearded Dragon,Up to 60,Up to 600,Various,15,Omnivore,"Deserts, Woodlands","Birds, Snakes",40-64,Australia,Not Evaluated,Agamidae,40-70,40-64,Solitary,Up to 24,"Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons or informally (especially in Australia) beardies. The name ""bearded dragon"" refers to the underside of the throat (or ""beard"") of the lizard, which can turn black and become inflated for a number of reasons, most often as a result of stress, if they feel threatened, or are trying to entice a mate. They are a semiarboreal species, spending significant amounts of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons and sleep at night, making them a diurnal species. Their diet consists primarily of vegetation and some insects. They are found throughout much of Australia and inhabit environments such as deserts, and shrublands.

The genus Pogona is in the subfamily Amphibolurinae of the lizard group Agamidae. Bearded dragons are characterized by their broad, triangular heads, flattened bodies, and rows and clusters of spiny scales covering their entire bodies. When threatened, bearded dragons puff up their bodies and beards to ward off predators and make their somewhat dull spikes seem more dangerous. Bearded dragons display a hand-waving gesture to show submission (most often when acknowledging another bearded dragon's territory), and a head-bobbing display to show dominance between dragons. Some have the ability to slightly change color in response to certain stimuli including rivalry challenges between males and ambient temperature changes (e.g., turning black to absorb heat). Bearded dragons occur in a variety of colors and morphs and can range from being all dark to completely white under controlled breeding conditions. Males grow up to 60 cm (24 in) long, and females up to 51 cm (20 in).

Bearded dragons live in the woodlands, heaths, deserts and coastal dunes, with their range extending throughout the interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern Territory. They are considered to be semiarboreal and quite readily climb and bask at height. This is also linked to dominance behavior and competition for territory/basking areas. They can be found on fallen/broken trees, rocky outcrops, and bushes when basking. Many of the Australian locals have spotted bearded dragons on fence posts and elevated rocky areas. At night, they prefer to dig holes to sleep in, climb in trees, or submerge themselves in rocks and like to climb into the cracks and crevices of stones and caves.

Bearded dragons go through a type of hibernation called brumation, in which like hibernation, reptiles go months without eating, but sporadically drink water. Reptiles go dormant in the hottest temperatures, but it differs from brumation during cooler temperatures. When temperatures are extreme, a very small range of temperatures exists through which the reptile's bodies can stay active and where their bodies cannot tolerate the extreme heat and they die. Bearded dragons go through brumation when the temperature goes below 15.5–21.0°C (60–70°F) during the night and 24.0–26.5°C (75–80°F) during the day for 8-10 hours. When the climate is too hot they will often burrow underground. They will also form more permanent burrows or covered hiding places to use as protection from the climate changes at night and predation."
Bengal Fox,35-40,2.5-4,Yellowish-gray,8,Omnivore,Grasslands,"Wolves, Birds of Prey",40,"India, Nepal, Bhutan",Least Concern,Canidae,50-60,40,Solitary,05-Feb,"The Bengal fox (Vulpes bengalensis), also known as the Indian fox, is a fox endemic to the Indian subcontinent from the Himalayan foothills and Terai of Nepal through southern India, and from southern and eastern Pakistan to eastern India and southeastern Bangladesh.

Vulpes bengalensis is a relatively small fox with an elongated muzzle, long, pointed ears, and a long, bushy tail. The pelage ranges in color from buff to silver-gray with an overall grizzled effect; the dorsal pelage is mostly grayish and paler ventrally. The legs tend to be brownish or rufous, and the underparts light, a pale sand or ginger shade. The Bengal fox is more daintily built than the red fox (V. vulpes), and can readily be recognized by its bushy, black-tipped tail, which is around 50–60% of the length of the head and body.

The backs of the ears are dark brown with a black margin, and white inside. The ears have the same colour as the nape or maybe darker, but not having a dark patch as in V. vulpes. Its rhinarium is naked and the lips are black. The muzzle is pointy, and there may be a dark smudged marking along the upper part of muzzle in front of eyes. Extensive variation in coat colour exists across populations and seasonally within populations, but generally varies from grey to pale brown. The head and body length is 18 in (46 cm), with a 10 in (25 cm) long tail. Typical weight is 5 to 9 pounds (2.3 to 4.1 kg).

Bengal foxes are predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal; while individuals may sometimes become active during cool periods of daytime, they typically spend warmer daylight hours under vegetation or in subterranean dens. They use three distinct types of den: basic, compact dens with two openings used for short rest periods, complex dens with multiple openings, and dens under rocks or rock crevices. The basic social unit of the Bengal Fox is the breeding pair, formed by a pair of bonds that can last for many years. Larger aggregations may occur while grown pups linger longer than average in the natal community. Other findings indicate that Bengal foxes can sometimes be more social. Female Bengal foxes were reported to share dens during lactation and four adult foxes were seen emerging from the same den. Bengal foxes are not especially suspicious of humans and can be found near human habitation. They are easy to tame.

Bengal foxes are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders, feeding primarily on insects, small mammals, reptiles, small birds, and fruits. Bengal foxes make a wide range of vocalizations. A common vocalization is a ""chattering cry"" that seems to have a significant role in establishing territoriality and may also be used as a warning call. They also growl, whimper, whine and make a sound which could be called a growl-bark. In reaction to humans, yapping or baying has also been observed. The Bengal fox does not appear to have latrine behaviour, a feature seen in some social canids, in which all members defecate at specific spots. They can be heard howling in the night in groups."
Bengal Tiger,90-110,220-260,"Orange, Black",15,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Mangroves","Humans, Crocodiles",65,"India, Bangladesh, Nepal",Endangered,Felidae,104-106,65,Solitary,2-4 (usually),"The Bengal tiger or Royal Bengal tiger is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies and the nominate tiger subspecies. It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today. It is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene for about 12,000 to 16,500 years. Its historical range covered the Indus River valley until the early 19th century, almost all of India, western Pakistan, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and southwestern China. Today, it inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and southwestern China. It is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.

As of 2022, the Bengal tiger population was estimated at 3,167–3,682 individuals in India, 316–355 individuals in Nepal, 131 individuals in Bhutan and around 114 individuals in Bangladesh. The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white tiger is a recessive mutant, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar and especially in the former State of Rewa. However, it is not an occurrence of albinism. The Bengal tiger ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today. Males and female Bengal tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve reach a head-to-body length of 183–211 cm (72–83 in) and 164–193 cm (65–76 in) respectively, including a tail about 85–110 cm (33–43 in) long. Total length ranges from 283 to 311 cm (111 to 122 in) for male tigers and 255–285 cm (100–112 in) for female tigers. They typically range from 90–110 cm (35–43 in) in shoulder height.

The basic social unit of the tiger is composed of a female and her offspring. Adult animals congregate only temporarily when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supplies of food. Otherwise, they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the forest and grassland animals upon which they prey. Resident adults of either sex maintain home ranges, confining their movements to definite habitats within which they satisfy their needs and those of their cubs, which include prey, water and shelter. In this site, they also maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other's movements and activities.

The Bengal tiger is a carnivore and prefers hunting large ungulates such as gaur, sambar, chital, barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Medium-sized prey includes wild boar, Indian hog deer, Indian muntjac and northern plains gray langur. Small prey such as porcupine, hare and peafowl form a small part of its diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into tiger habitat, it also preys on domestic livestock. Bengal tigers occasionally hunt and kill predators such as Indian leopard, mugger crocodile, Asian black bear, sloth bear, and dhole. They generally do not attack adult Indian elephant and Indian rhinoceros, but such extraordinarily rare events have been recorded."
Black Rhinoceros,132-180,"800-1,400","Gray, Black",35-50,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Lions, Hyenas",56,Eastern and Southern Africa,Critically Endangered,Rhinocerotidae,450-480,56,Solitary,1,"The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), sometimes also called the hook-lipped rhinoceros, is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern Africa and southern Africa, including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the species is referred to as black, its colours vary from brown to grey. It is the only extant species of the genus Diceros.

The species overall is classified as critically endangered (even though the south-western black rhinoceros is classified as near threatened) and is threatened by multiple factors including poaching and habitat reduction. Three subspecies have been declared extinct, including the western black rhinoceros, which was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011. The IUCN estimates that 3,142 mature individuals remain in the wild.

An adult black rhinoceros stands 132–180 cm (52–71 in) high at the shoulder and is 2.8–3.75 m (9.2–12.3 ft) in length. An adult typically weighs from 800 to 1,400 kg (1,760 to 3,090 lb), however unusually large male specimens have been reported at up to 2,896 kg (6,385 lb). Two horns on the skull are made of keratin with the larger front horn typically 50 cm (20 in) long, exceptionally up to 135.9 cm (53.5 in).

Their thick-layered skin helps to protect black rhinos from thorns and sharp grasses. Their skin harbors external parasites, such as mites and ticks, which may be eaten by oxpeckers and egrets. It is commonly assumed that black rhinos have poor eyesight, relying more on hearing and smell. However, studies have shown that their eyesight is comparatively good, at about the level of a rabbit. Their ears have a relatively wide rotational range to detect sounds. An excellent sense of smell alerts rhinos to the presence of predators.

Black rhinos are generally thought to be solitary, with the only strong bond between a mother and her calf. They are not very territorial and often intersect other rhino territories. Home ranges vary depending on season and the availability of food and water. Generally they have smaller home ranges and larger density in habitats that have plenty of food and water available, and vice versa if resources are not readily available.

Black rhinos have a reputation for being extremely aggressive, and charge readily at perceived threats. They have even been observed to charge tree trunks and termite mounds. Black rhinos will fight each other, and they have the highest rates of mortal combat recorded for any mammal: about 50 percent of males and 30 percent of females die from combat-related injuries. Adult rhinos normally have no natural predators, due to their imposing size, thick skin, and deadly horns. However, adult black rhinos have fallen prey to crocodiles in exceptional circumstances. Calves and, very seldom, small sub-adults may be preyed upon by lions as well.

Black rhinos are herbivorous browsers that eat leafy plants, twigs, branches, shoots, thorny wood bushes, small trees, legumes, fruit, and grass. The optimum habitat seems to be one consisting of thick scrub and bushland, often with some woodland, which supports the highest densities. Their diet can reduce the number of woody plants, which may benefit grazers (who focus on leaves and stems of grass), but not competing browsers (who focus on leaves, stems of trees, shrubs or herbs). It has been known to eat up to 220 species of plants."
Blobfish,Up to 30,Up to 10,Pinkish-gray,Up to 100,Carnivore,Deep-sea,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania",Vulnerable,Psychrolutidae,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"A blobfish, also known as a flathead sculpin (Psychrolutes phrictus), hovers in the caldera at Axial Seamount, approximately 300 miles off the Oregon coast. There are nine species of blobfish, all members of the Psychrolutes genus which live deep in the sea. If you were asked to think of the ugliest creature you can imagine, you might picture the blobfish: a pale pink gelatinous blob with a droopy, downturned mouth and large, sagging nose. After being named the world’s ugliest animal in 2013, this hideous fish soared to fame—with memes, songs, soft toys, and even TV characters created in its honor.

However, according to scientist Richard Arnott, this viral image of the blobfish is nothing more than “a vast bullying campaign.” The fish only looks like a miserable, pink lump when it has been torn from its home, and suffered devastating tissue damage due to the rapid depressurization as it was dragged to the surface. In its natural habitat—thousands of feet underwater—the misunderstood blobfish looks like a normal fish.

Blobfish look almost unrecognizable underwater: These tadpole-shaped fish have bulbous heads, large jaws, tapered tails, and feathery pectoral fins. Rather than scales, they have loose, flabby skin. They don’t have strong bones or thick muscle—instead, they rely on the water pressure to hold their shape together. That’s why blobfish collapse into a squishy mush when they are pulled up to the surface. Because they live at such incredible depths, these fascinating fish are hard to study in their natural environment. Much of what scientists have learned about them comes from dead blobfish pulled up to the surface—hence why their above-water form is more widely recognized.

Blobfish are usually found in dark, cold habitats deep at the bottom of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, between 1,970 and 3,940 feet deep. These animals are lie-in-wait predators, meaning they sit at the bottom of the ocean and eat anything that passes by, such as crustaceans, brittle stars, anemone, and carrion. This allows them to preserve energy, which is key to their survival.

The blobfish’s fascinating physiology is key to the animal’s survival in these extreme conditions. Unlike many other fish, which use a gas-filled sac to control buoyancy, blobfish don’t have a swim bladder. If they did, it would implode due to the extreme pressure.

Instead, the animal’s soft body has a high water and fat content, which helps them withstand the high pressure. The thick layer of jelly-like flesh under their skin makes blobfish slightly less dense than water and allows them to bob along the seabed.

These flabby fish have no known predators, but may be threatened by destructive human activities, such as deep-sea fishing and bottom trawling, which is when a weighted fishing net is dragged along the sea floor. As a fish that thrives in cold water, they may also be affected by the world’s warming oceans.

But groups like the Ugly Animal Preservation Society aim to raise awareness of the need to protect the blobfish, along with other aesthetically challenged creatures, which are less likely to be researched or protected than their cuter counterparts."
Blue Jay,22-30,0.07-0.12,"Blue, White",15,Omnivore,"Forests, Urban Areas","Birds of Prey, Snakes",32,North America,Least Concern,Corvidae,17-18,32,Flocks,06-Feb,"The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, which does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized.

The blue jay feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later; soft fruits; arthropods; and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jays can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.

It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months. The name jay derives from the bird's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious. Jays are also called jaybirds.

The blue jay occurs from southern Canada and throughout the eastern and central United States south to Florida and northeastern Texas. The western edge of the range stops where the arid pine forest and scrub habitat of the closely related Steller's jay (C. stelleri) begins, generally in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Recently, the range of the blue jay has extended northwestwards so that it is now a rare but regularly seen winter visitor along the northern US and southern Canadian Pacific Coast.

The blue jay is a noisy, bold, and aggressive passerine. It is a moderately slow flier (roughly 32–40 km/h or 20–25 mph) when unprovoked. It flies with body and tail held level, with slow wing beats. Its slow flying speeds make this species easy prey for hawks and owls when it flies in open areas. Virtually all the raptorial birds sympatric in distribution with the blue jay may prey upon it, especially swift bird-hunting specialists such as the Accipiter hawks. Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledgling stage, including tree squirrels, snakes, cats, crows, raccoons, opossums, other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults.

The blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species, as it may chase predatory birds, such as hawks and owls, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors, especially those of the red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks, possibly to test whether a hawk is in the vicinity, though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources."

Its wingspan is approximately 12 cm (4.7""), and its dorsal forewings and hindwings are a bright, iridescent blue edged with black, while the ventral surfaces are brown. Its iridescent wings are an area of interest in research because of their unique microstructure. Due to its characteristic blue color, Morpho menelaus is considered valuable among collectors and was widely hunted in the 20th century.

This neotropical butterfly is found in Central and South America, including the Cerrado which is a vast tropical savanna in Brazil. Other locations include Mexico and Venezuela. Females inhabit the forest understory and perch on tree stumps, but are found near the tree tops when it is time to lay eggs. Both sexes have a slow and floppy flight pattern and feed on rotting fruit that has dropped to the ground. Males tend to fly in open clearings or high in the canopy. These butterflies collectively emerge in the beginning and the end of the wet season in Cerrado. They do not appear in the middle of the wet season because the heavy rain can cause physical harm to their wings. Their emergence depends on the availability of food which is dependent on climate. For protection from the rain, Morpho menelaus prefers small and enclosed spaces.

The egg of the Morpho menelaus butterfly is typically small, round, and somewhat flattened. They are usually pale green or whitish in color, sometimes with a slightly metallic sheen, but not as vibrant as the adult butterfly's iridescent blue wings, and shaped like dew drops. The female laid around 12 eggs in cluster of 5 or 6 eggs on the undersides of the leaves. The eggs are laid so that the caterpillars may feed as soon as they hatch.

These social caterpillars feed on Erythroxylum, Dalbergia, and Fabaceae, and may prefer to feed on new leaves of host plants since these new leaves are easier and more nutritious to eat. The caterpillars are red-brown in color with bright green spots. They are covered with bristles that release an irritant upon contact. Conversely, the peak of the caterpillar is in the dry season, a climate that is unsuitable for most animal communities. These caterpillars will enter diapause or suspend development and can delay pupation in order to survive this harsh period and the lack of water. As the dry season continues, the caterpillar population declines due to predation.

One of the best seasonal predictors of adult butterfly occurrence is the ripening of zoochorous fruit. Adult emergence occurs primarily in the beginning of the wet season, when the climate and air humidity makes food resources plentiful and oviposition advantageous. The butterfly spends 3 to 4 weeks as an adult, and the entire life cycle is about 115 days. Adults fly along rivers, or anywhere that open land has been revealed."
Blue Whale,Up to 33.5m,Up to 200 tons,Blue-grey,70-90,Filter Feeder,Oceans,Orcas,40,Oceans worldwide,Endangered,Balaenopteridae,10-12 months,39,Solitary,1 (rarely 2),"The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 m (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 t (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal known ever to have existed. The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue on its upper surface and somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, and B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.

In general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer feeding areas near the poles and their winter breeding grounds near the tropics. There is also evidence of year-round residencies, and partial or age/sex-based migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet consists almost exclusively of krill. They are generally solitary or gather in small groups, and have no well-defined social structure other than mother–calf bonds. Blue whales vocalize, with a fundamental frequency ranging from 8 to 25 Hz; their vocalizations may vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are their only natural predators.

The blue whale was abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as Endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise, and climate change.

The blue whale is a slender-bodied cetacean with a broad U-shaped head; thin, elongated flippers; a small 33 centimeters (13 in) sickle-shaped dorsal fin located close to the tail, and a large tail stock at the root of the wide and thin flukes. The upper jaw is lined with 70–395 black baleen plates. The throat region has 60–88 grooves which allows the skin to expand during feeding. It has two blowholes that can squirt 9.1–12.2 meters (30–40 ft) up in the air. The skin has a mottled grayish-blue coloration, appearing blue underwater. The underbelly has lighter pigmentation and can appear yellowish due to diatoms in the water, which historically earned them the nickname ""sulphur bottom"".

The blue whale is the largest animal known ever to have existed. Female blue whales are larger than males. The average length of sexually mature female blue whales is 22.0 meters (72.1 ft) for Eastern North Pacific blue whales, 24 meters (79 ft) for central and western North Pacific blue whales, 21–24 meters (68–78 ft) for North Atlantic blue whales, 25.4–26.3 meters (83.4–86.3 ft) for Antarctic blue whales, 23.5 meters (77.1 ft) for Chilean blue whales, and 21.3 meters (69.9 ft) for pygmy blue whales.

In the Northern Hemisphere, males weigh an average 100 metric tons (220,000 lb) and females 112 metric tons (247,000 lb). Eastern North Pacific blue whale males average 88.5 tonnes (195,000 lb) and females 100 tonnes (220,000 lb). Antarctic males average 112 tonnes (247,000 lb) and females 130 tonnes (290,000 lb). Pygmy blue whale males average 83.5 tonnes (184,000 lb) to 99 tonnes (218,000 lb)."
Blue-Footed Booby,81-85,1.5-3,"Blue, White",17,Piscivore,Coastal Areas,"Orcas, Sharks",25-35,Eastern Pacific (GalÃƒÂ¡pagos Islands),Least Concern,Sulidae,41-45,25-35,Group-based,1,"The blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) is a marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is one of six species of the genus Sula – known as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a sexually selected trait and a product of their diet. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. 

The natural breeding habitats of the blue-footed booby are the tropical and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the Gulf of California south along the western coasts of Central and South America to Peru. About half of all breeding pairs nest on the Galápagos Islands. Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming under water in search of its prey. It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in groups.

The blue-footed booby usually lays one to three eggs at a time. The species practices asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity. This makes the blue-footed booby an important model for studying parent–offspring conflict and sibling rivalry.

The blue-footed booby is on average 81 cm (32 in) long and weighs 1.5 kg (3+1⁄4 lb), with the female being slightly larger than the male. Its wings are long, pointed, and brown in color. The neck and head of the blue-footed booby are light brown with white streaks, while the belly and underside exhibit pure white plumage. Its eyes are placed on either side of its bill and oriented towards the front, enabling excellent binocular vision. Its eyes are a distinctive yellow, with the male having more yellow in its irises than the female. Blue-footed booby chicks have black beaks and feet and are clad in a layer of soft white down.

Since the blue-footed booby preys on fish by diving headlong into the water, its nostrils are permanently closed, and it has to breathe through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females. Its blue feet play a key role in courtship rituals and breeding, with the male visually displaying his feet to attract mates during the breeding season.

The blue-footed booby is a specialized fish eater, feeding on small schooling fish such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. It will also take squid and offal. The blue-footed booby hunts by diving into the ocean after prey, sometimes from a great height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey. It can hunt singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks. Boobies travel in parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it signals to the rest of the group and they all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows."
Blue-Ringed Octopus,Up to 20,Up to 0.3,"Blue, Brown",6-8 months,Carnivore,"Coral Reefs, Tide Pools",Larger Fish,Not Applicable,Indo-Pacific region,Near Threatened,Octopodidae,50-70,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 100,"Blue-ringed octopuses, comprising the genus Hapalochlaena, are four extremely venomous species of octopus that are found in tide pools and coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian oceans, from Japan to Australia. They can be identified by their yellowish skin and characteristic blue and black rings that can change color dramatically when the animal is threatened. They eat small crustaceans, including crabs, hermit crabs, shrimp, and other small sea animals. They are one of the world's most venomous marine animals. Despite their small size—12 to 20 cm (5 to 8 in)—and relatively docile nature, they are very dangerous if provoked when handled because their venom contains a powerful neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin.

Blue-ringed octopuses spend most of their time hiding in crevices while displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. Like all octopuses, they can change shape easily, which allows them to squeeze into crevices much smaller than themselves. This, along with piling up rocks outside the entrance to its lair, helps safeguard the octopus from predators. If they are provoked, they quickly change color, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50–60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second as an aposematic warning display. 

In the greater blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata), the rings contain multi-layer light reflectors called iridophores. These are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. Beneath and around each ring are dark pigmented chromatophores which can be expanded within 1 second to enhance the contrast of the rings. There are no chromatophores above the ring, which is unusual for cephalopods as they typically use chromatophores to cover or spectrally modify iridescence. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved by using muscles which are under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the iridescence is exposed, thereby revealing the blue color. Similar to other Octopoda, the blue-ringed octopus swims by expelling water from a funnel in a form of jet propulsion.

The blue-ringed octopus often feeds on fish and crustaceans. It pounces on its prey, seizing it with its arms and pulling it towards its mouth. It uses its horny beak to pierce through the tough crab or shrimp exoskeleton, releasing its venom. The venom paralyzes the muscles required for movement, which effectively kills the prey. The blue-ringed octopus, despite its small size, carries enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes. Their bites are tiny and often painless, with many victims not realizing they have been envenomated until respiratory depression and paralysis begins. No blue-ringed octopus antivenom is available.

Currently, the blue-ringed octopus population information is listed as Least Concern according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, threats such as bioprospecting, habitat fragmentation, degradation, overfishing, and human disturbance, as well as species collections for aquarium trade, may be threats to population numbers."
Bonobo,Up to 150,30-40,Black,40-60,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",40-60,Democratic Republic of Congo,Endangered,Hominidae,220-230,40-60,Social groups,1,"The bonobo (Pan paniscus), also historically called the pygmy chimpanzee (less often the dwarf chimpanzee or gracile chimpanzee), is an endangered great ape and one of the two species making up the genus Pan (the other being the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes). While bonobos are, today, recognized as a distinct species in their own right, they were initially thought to be a subspecies of Pan troglodytes, due to the physical similarities between the two species. Taxonomically, members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina—composed entirely by the genus Pan—are collectively termed panins.

Bonobos are distinguished from common chimpanzees by relatively long limbs, pinker lips, a darker face, a tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted, longer hair on their heads. Some individuals have sparser, thin hair over parts of their bodies. The bonobo is found in a 500,000 km2 (190,000 sq mi) area within the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central Africa. It is predominantly frugivorous, compared to the often highly omnivorous diets and hunting of small monkeys, duiker and other antelope exhibited by common chimpanzees. Bonobos inhabit primary and secondary forest, including seasonally inundated swamp forest. Because of political instability in the region, and the general timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.

The bonobo is commonly considered to be more gracile than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males. Body mass ranges from 34 to 60 kg (75 to 132 lb) with an average weight of 45 kilograms (99 lb) in males against an average of 33 kg (73 lb) in females.

According to studies published in 2017 by researchers at The George Washington University, the ancestors of the genus Pan split from the human line about 8 million years ago; moreover, bonobos split from the common chimpanzee line about 2 million years ago. Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the natural formation of the Congo River (around 1.5–2 million years ago) possibly led to the isolation and speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete figures regarding population, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is most threatened by habitat destruction, human population growth and movement (as well as ongoing civil unrest and political infighting), with commercial poaching being, by far, the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it is almost certainly much shorter."
Bornean Orangutan,96-150,30-82,Reddish-brown,35-45,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Tigers, Humans",40-64,Borneo,Critically Endangered,Hominidae,230-270,40-64,Solitary,1,"The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) is a species of orangutan endemic to the island of Borneo. Together with the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) and Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), it belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. It is the largest of the three species of orangutans. Like the other great apes, orangutans are highly intelligent, displaying tool use and distinct cultural patterns in the wild. Orangutans share approximately 97% of their DNA with humans. Also called mias by the local population, the Bornean orangutan is a critically endangered species, with deforestation, palm oil plantations, and hunting posing a serious threat to its continued existence. 

The Bornean orangutan is the third-largest ape after the western gorilla, and the largest truly arboreal (or tree-dwelling) extant ape. Body weights broadly overlap with the considerably taller Homo sapiens, but the latter is considerably more variable in size. By comparison, the Sumatran orangutan is similar in size but, on average, is marginally lighter in weight. A survey of wild orangutans found that males weigh on average 75 kg (165 lb), ranging from 50–100 kg (110–220 lb), and 1.2–1.7 m (3.9–5.6 ft) long; females average 38.5 kg (85 lb), ranging from 30–50 kg (66–110 lb), and 1–1.2 m (3.3–3.9 ft) long. 

The Bornean orangutan has a distinctive body shape with very long arms that may reach up to 1.5 metres in length. It has grey skin, a coarse, shaggy, reddish coat and prehensile, grasping hands and feet. Its coat does not cover its face unlike most mammals, although Bornean orangutans do have some hair on their faces including a beard and mustache. It also has large, fatty cheek pads known as flanges as well as a pendulous throat sac.

Bornean orangutans are highly sexually dimorphic and have several features that differ between males and females. Males have much larger cheek pads, or flanges, that are composed of muscle and large amounts of fat. In females, the flanges are mostly composed of muscle. Males have relatively larger canines and premolars. Males have a more pronounced beard and mustache. The throat sac in males is also considerably larger. There are two body types for sexually mature males: smaller or larger. Larger males are more dominant but smaller males still breed successfully. There is little sexual dimorphism at birth.

The Bornean orangutan diet is composed of over 400 types of food, including wild figs, durians (Durio zibethinus and D. graveolens), leaves, seeds, bird eggs, flowers, sap, vines, honey, fungi, spider webs, insects, and, to a lesser extent than the Sumatran orangutan, bark. They have also been known to consume the inner shoots of plants and vines. They will also occasionally eat nutrient rich soil. They get the necessary quantities of water from both fruit and from tree holes.

Bornean orangutans have been sighted using spears to attempt (unsuccessfully) to catch fish. The species has been observed using tools such as leaves to wipe off faeces, a pad of leaves for holding spiny durian fruit, a leafy branch for a bee swatter, a bunch of leafy branches held together as an ""umbrella"" while traveling in the rain, a single stick as backscratcher, and a branch or tree trunk as a missile. In some regions, orangutans occasionally eat soil to get minerals that may neutralize the toxins and acids they consume in their primarily vegetarian diets. On rare occasions, orangutans will prey upon other, smaller primates, such as slow lorises."
Bottlenose Dolphin,200-400,150-650,Grey,20-50,Carnivore,Oceans,"Sharks, Orcas",37,Oceans worldwide,Least Concern,Delphinidae,12 months,64,Social pods,1,"The bottlenose dolphin is a toothed whale in the genus Tursiops. They are common, cosmopolitan members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphins. Molecular studies show the genus contains three species: the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), and Tamanend's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops erebennus). Others, like the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops (aduncus) australis), may be alternately considered their own species or be subspecies of T. aduncus. Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions. Their name derives from the Latin tursio (dolphin) and truncatus for the truncated teeth (the type specimen was old and had worn down teeth; this is not a typical characteristic of most members of the species).

Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging; using marine sponges to forage for food sources they normally could not access) and transmit cultural knowledge from generation to generation, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.

Bottlenose dolphins have the third largest encephalization levels of any mammal on Earth (humans have the largest, followed by Northern Right whale dolphins), sharing close ratios with those of humans and other cetaceans, while being twice as high of other great apes. This more than likely contributes to their high intelligence.

The bottlenose dolphin weighs an average of 300 kg (660 lb), but can range from 150 and 650 kg (330 and 1,430 lb). It can reach a length of just over 4 m (13 ft). Its color varies considerably, is usually dark gray on the back and lighter gray on the flanks, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin. This is called countershading and is a form of camouflage. Older dolphins sometimes have a few spots.

Fish is one of the main items in the dolphin diet. They also eat shrimps, squid, mollusks, and cuttlefish, and only swallow the soft parts. They eat 22 pounds of fish a day. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they work as a team to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called ""fish whacking"". ""Strand feeding"" is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore. This happens only during low tides."
Boxer Dog,53-63,25-32,"Fawn, Brindle",12,Omnivore,Human Dwellings,Not Applicable,64,Worldwide,Not Applicable,Canidae,63,64,Social groups,08-Mar,"The Boxer is a medium to large, short-haired dog breed of mastiff-type, developed in Germany. The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. 

The head is the most distinctive feature of the Boxer. The breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light. The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull. The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3. Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle. In addition, a Boxer should be slightly prognathous, i.e., the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an underbite or ""undershot bite"".

Boxers are a bright, energetic, and playful breed and tend to be very good with children. They are patient and spirited with children, but also protective, making them a popular choice for families. They are active, strong dogs that require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being ""headstrong"", which can be related to inappropriate obedience training. Owing to their intelligence and working-breed characteristics, training based on corrections often has limited usefulness. Boxers, like other animals, typically respond better to positive reinforcement techniques such as clicker training, an approach based on operant conditioning and behaviorism, which offers the dog an opportunity to think independently and to problem-solve.

Boxers need plenty of exercise, which means their diet should be high in quality calories. The main source of these calories should be lean animal protein, which includes lean chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish. While on a high calorie diet, owners should be thoughtful of the amount of treats given as this tends to cause obesity. Owners should be mindful of the food to snack ratio being consumed by the Boxer when determining how many treats are acceptable. Some healthy snacks include raw fruits and vegetables.

Boxers are friendly, lively companions that are popular as family dogs. Their suspicion of strangers, alertness, agility, and strength make them formidable guard dogs. They sometimes appear at dog agility or dog obedience trials and flyball events. These strong and intelligent animals have also been used as service dogs, guide dogs for the blind, therapy dogs, police dogs in K9 units, and occasionally herding cattle or sheep. The versatility of Boxers was recognized early on by the military, which has used them as valuable messenger dogs, pack carriers, and attack and guard dogs in times of war."
Brazilian Wandering Spider,Up to 5,Up to 0.006,Brown,2,Carnivore,Forests,"Birds, Mammals",Not Applicable,South and Central America,Not Evaluated,Ctenidae,21-35,Not Applicable,Solitary,"Up to 1,000","Phoneutria is a genus of spiders in the family Ctenidae. They are mainly found in northern South America, with one species in Central America. Members of the genus are commonly referred to as Brazilian wandering spiders. Other English names include armed spiders (armadeiras in Brazilian Portuguese) and banana spiders (a name shared with several others).

The spiders in the genus can grow to have a leg span of 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in). Their body length ranges from 17 to 48 mm (43⁄64 to 1+57⁄64 in). Phoneutria are easily confused with several other non-medically significant ctenids, especially Cupiennius, in which the recently described C. chiapanensis also has bright red hairs on the chelicerae. Additionally, some Phoneutria species lack red hairs on the chelicerae, making it an unreliable identification feature. The presence of a dark linear stripe or stripes on the frontal (dorsal) palps and presence of a single thin black line running anterior-posterior along the dorsal carapace may help identify Phoneutria. Other features are the strong ventral marking on the underside of the legs with contrasting dark mid-segments and lighter joints, and the pattern on the ventral (underside) of the abdomen with several rows of black dots, or an overall reddish colour.

The characteristic defensive posture with frontal legs held high is an especially good indicator to confirm a specimen is Phoneutria, especially alongside correct colour patterns. During the defensive display the body is lifted up into an erect position, the first two pairs of legs are lifted high (revealing the conspicuous black/light-banded pattern on the leg underside), while the spider sways from side to side with hind legs in a cocked position.

Wandering spiders are so-called because they wander the jungle floor at night, rather than residing in a lair or maintaining a web. During the day they hide inside termite mounds, under fallen logs and rocks, and in banana plants (hence the ""banana spider"" nickname) and bromeliads. P. nigriventer is known to hide in dark and moist places in or near human dwellings. P. nigriventer mates during the dry season from April to June, which leads to frequent observations of the species during this time.

Phoneutria are found in forests from Costa Rica southwards throughout South America east of the Andes including Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and into northern Argentina. Three species (P. reidyi, P. boliviensis and P. fera) are found in the Amazon region, one species (P. fera) is restricted to the Amazon, and one (P. depilata) ranges into Central America in Panama and Costa Rica. The remaining species are restricted to Atlantic Forest of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, including forest fragments in the Cerrado savanna. In Brazil, Phoneutria is only absent in the northeastern region north of Salvador, Bahia. Phoneutria has been introduced to Chile and Uruguay.

The genus Phoneutria includes some of the relatively few species of spiders known to present a threat to humans. Danger to humans does not only comprise toxicity, but also factors such as the spider's capacity to deliver a sufficient dose of venom, a disposition that makes a bite likely, and proximity to human habitation. These spiders' wandering nature is another reason they are considered so dangerous. In densely populated areas, Phoneutria species usually search for cover and dark places to hide during daytime, leading them to hide in houses, clothes, cars, boots, boxes and log piles, where they may bite if accidentally disturbed."
Brown Bear,70-120,70-780,Brown,20-30,Omnivore,"Forests, Mountains","Wolves, Tigers",48,"North America, Europe, Asia",Least Concern,Ursidae,180-250,48,Solitary,04-Jan,"The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America. Of the carnivorans, it is rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females. The fur ranges in color from cream to reddish to dark brown. It has evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears, and paws up to 21 cm (8.3 in) wide and 36 cm (14 in) long, to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.

Throughout the brown bear's range, it inhabits mainly forested habitats in elevations of up to 5,000 m (16,000 ft). It is omnivorous, and consumes a variety of plant and animal species. Contrary to popular belief, the brown bear derives 90% of its diet from plants. When hunting, it will target animals as small as rodents, to those as large as moose or muskoxen. In parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears predominantly feed on spawning salmon that come near shore to lay their eggs. For most of the year, it is a usually solitary animal that associates only when mating or raising cubs. Females give birth to an average of one to three cubs that remain with their mother for 1.5 to 4.5 years. It is a long-lived animal, with an average lifespan of 25 years in the wild. Relative to its body size, the brown bear has an exceptionally large brain. This large brain allows for high cognitive abilities, such as tool use. Attacks on humans, though widely reported, are generally rare.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across its wide range, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017 of 110,000. Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa and the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of the populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of the smaller-bodied forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered: it occupies only 2% of its former range and is threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of only about 50 bears.

The brown bear is considered to be one of the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in zoos since ancient times, and has been tamed and trained to perform in circuses and other acts. For thousands of years, the brown bear has had a role in human culture, and is often featured in literature, art, folklore, and mythology."
Burmese Python,Up to 460,Up to 90,"Brown, Black",20-25,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Leopards, Hawksbills",1.6-2.4,"Southeast Asia, South Asia, Indonesia",Least Concern,Pythonidae,88-100,1.6-2.4,Solitary,30-80,"The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is one of the largest species of snakes. It is native to a large area of Southeast Asia and is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Until 2009, it was considered a subspecies of the Indian python, but is now recognized as a distinct species. It is an invasive species in Florida as a result of the pet trade.

The Burmese python is a dark-colored non-venomous snake with many brown blotches bordered by black down the back. In the wild, Burmese pythons typically grow to 5 m (16 ft). This species is sexually dimorphic in size; females average only slightly longer, but are considerably heavier and bulkier than the males. For example, length-weight comparisons in captive Burmese pythons for individual females have shown: at 3.47 m (11 ft 5 in) length, a specimen weighed 29 kg (64 lb), a specimen of just over 4 m (13 ft) weighed 36 kg (79 lb), a specimen of 4.5 m (15 ft) weighed 40 kg (88 lb), and a specimen of 5 m (16 ft) weighed 75 kg (165 lb). In comparison, length-weight comparisons for males found: a specimen of 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) weighed 12 kg (26 lb), 2.97 m (9 ft 9 in) weighed 14.5 kg (32 lb), a specimen of 3 m (9.8 ft) weighed 7 kg (15 lb), and a specimen of 3.05 m (10.0 ft) weighed 18.5 kg (41 lb).

The Burmese python occurs throughout Southern and Southeast Asia, including eastern India, southeastern Nepal, western Bhutan, southeastern Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, northern continental Malaysia, and southern China in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It also occurs in Hong Kong, and in Indonesia on Java, southern Sulawesi, Bali, and Sumbawa. It has also been reported in Kinmen. It is an excellent swimmer and needs a permanent source of water. It lives in grasslands, marshes, swamps, rocky foothills, woodlands, river valleys, and jungles with open clearings. It is a good climber and has a prehensile tail. It can stay in water for 30 minutes but mostly stays on land.

Burmese pythons are mainly nocturnal rainforest dwellers. When young, they are equally at home on the ground and in trees, but as they gain girth, they tend to restrict most of their movements to the ground. They are also excellent swimmers, being able to stay submerged for up to half an hour. Burmese pythons spend the majority of their time hidden in the underbrush. In the northern parts of its range, the Burmese python may brumate for some months during the cold season in a hollow tree, a hole in the riverbank, or under rocks. They tend to be solitary and are usually found in pairs only when mating.

Like all snakes, the Burmese python is carnivorous. Its diet consists primarily of birds and mammals, but also includes amphibians and reptiles. It is a sit-and-wait predator, meaning it spends most of its time staying relatively still, waiting for prey to approach, then striking rapidly."
Capybara,50-62,35-66,Brown,10,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Swamps","Jaguars, Anacondas",30-35,South America,Least Concern,Caviidae,150,35,Group-based,08-Feb,"The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent, native to South America. It is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.

The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair. Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9 kg (108 lb). Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.

Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found throughout all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.

Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. Like other rodents, a capybara's front teeth grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously."
Cheetah,70-90,20-72,Tan with Black Spots,12,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Savannas","Lions, Hyenas",112,"Africa, Iran, India",Vulnerable,Felidae,90-98,112,Solitary,05-Mar,"The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat and the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). The cheetah is capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h (58 to 65 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.

The cheetah was first described in the late 18th century. Four subspecies are recognised today that are native to Africa and central Iran. An African subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is now distributed mainly in small, fragmented populations in northwestern, eastern and southern Africa and central Iran. It lives in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the Sahara, and hilly desert terrain.

The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their cubs, male ""coalitions"", and solitary males. While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson's gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey within 60–100 m (200–330 ft) before charging towards it, trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, females give birth to a litter of three or four cubs. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores. They are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age.

The cheetah is threatened by several factors, like habitat loss and fragmentation of populations. Habitat loss is caused mainly by the introduction of commercial land use, such as agriculture and industry. It is further aggravated by ecological degradation, like woody plant encroachment, which is common in southern Africa. Moreover, the species apparently requires a sizeable area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. Shortage of prey and conflict with other species such as humans and large carnivores are other major threats. The reduced genetic variability makes cheetahs more vulnerable to diseases; however, the threat posed by infectious diseases may be minor, given the low population densities and hence a reduced chance of infection.

The global cheetah population was estimated in 2021 at 6,517; it is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It has been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation. It was tamed in ancient Egypt and trained for hunting ungulates in the Arabian Peninsula and India. It has been kept in zoos since the early 19th century."
Chimpanzee,Up to 160,26-70,Black,40-50,Omnivore,"Rainforests, Grasslands","Leopards, Humans",40,Central and West Africa,Endangered,Hominidae,230-240,40,Social groups,1,"The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also simply known as the chimp, is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed one. When its close relative the bonobo was more commonly known as the pygmy chimpanzee, this species was often called the common chimpanzee or the robust chimpanzee. The chimpanzee and the bonobo are the only species in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is thus humans' closest living relative.

The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more robust than the bonobo, weighing 40–70 kg (88–154 lb) for males and 27–50 kg (60–110 lb) for females and standing 150 cm (4 ft 11 in).

The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more.

The chimpanzee is a highly adaptable species. It lives in a variety of habitats, including dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, montane forest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic. The chimpanzee has an advanced cognitive map of its home range and can repeatedly find food. The chimpanzee builds a sleeping nest in a tree in a different location each night, never using the same nest more than once. Chimpanzees sleep alone in separate nests except for infants or juvenile chimpanzees, which sleep with their mothers.

The chimpanzee is an omnivorous frugivore. It prefers fruit above all other food, but it also eats leaves, leaf buds, seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark, and resin. While the chimpanzee is mostly herbivorous, it does eat honey, soil, insects, birds and their eggs, and small to medium-sized mammals, including other primates. Insect species consumed include the weaver ant Oecophylla longinoda, Macrotermes termites, and honey bees.

The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees' tea parties, circus acts and stage shows. Although chimpanzees have been kept as pets, their strength, aggressiveness, and unpredictability makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in the United States. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees, with limited success."
Chinese Giant Salamander,Up to 180,Up to 65,Dark Brown,Up to 70,Carnivore,Freshwater,"Fish, Crustaceans",Not Applicable,China,Critically Endangered,Cryptobranchidae,50-60,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is one of the largest salamanders and one of the largest amphibians in the world. It is fully aquatic, and is endemic to rocky mountain streams and lakes in the Yangtze river basin of central China. It has also been introduced to Kyoto Prefecture in Japan, and possibly to Taiwan. It is considered critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, pollution, and overcollection, as it is considered a delicacy and used in traditional Chinese medicine. On farms in central China, it is extensively farmed and sometimes bred, although many of the salamanders on the farms are caught in the wild. It has been listed as one of the top-10 ""focal species"" in 2008 by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project.

It has a large head, small eyes and dark wrinkly skin. Its flat, broad head has a wide mouth, round, lidless eyes, and a line of paired tubercles that run around its head and throat. Its color is typically dark brown with a mottled or speckled pattern, but it can also be other brownish tones, dark reddish, or black. Albinos, which are white or orange, have been recorded. All species of giant salamanders produce a sticky, white skin secretion that repels predators.

The giant salamander is known to vocalize, making barking, whining, hissing, or crying sounds. Some of these vocalizations bear a striking resemblance to the crying of a young human child, and as such, it is known in the Chinese language as the ""infant fish"".

The Chinese giant salamander has been recorded feeding on insects, millipedes, horsehair worms, amphibians (both frogs and salamanders), freshwater crabs, shrimp, fish (such as Saurogobio and Cobitis), and Asiatic water shrew. Presumably ingested by mistake, plant material and gravel have also been found in their stomachs. Cannibalism is frequent; in a study of 79 specimens from the Qinling–Dabashan range, the stomach content of five included remains of other Chinese giant salamanders and this made up 28% of the combined weight of all food items in the study. The most frequent items in the same study were freshwater crabs (found in 19 specimens), which made up 23% of the combined weight of all food items. It has very poor eyesight, so it depends on special sensory nodes that run in a line on the body from head to tail. It is capable of sensing the slightest vibrations around it with the help of these nodes. 

The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a ""living fossil"". Although protected under Chinese law and CITES Appendix I, the wild population has declined by more than an estimated 80% since the 1950s. Although traditionally recognized as one of two living species of Andrias salamander in Asia, the other being the Japanese giant salamander, evidence indicates that the Chinese giant salamander may be composed of at least five cryptic species, further compounding each individual species' endangerment."
Clownfish,10-Jul,50-300,Orange,10,Omnivore,Coral Reefs,"Larger Fish, Anemones",8,"Indian, Pacific Oceans",Not Evaluated,Pomacentridae,10-Jun,1.6,Group-based,"Up to 1,000","Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species of clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion. In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species, anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a length of 17 cm (6+1⁄2 in), while the smallest barely achieve 7–8 cm (2+3⁄4–3+1⁄4 in).

Anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea, and Pacific Ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, Southeast Asia, Japan, and the Indo-Malaysian region. While most species have restricted distributions, others are widespread. Anemonefish typically live at the bottom of shallow seas in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. No anemonefish are found in the Atlantic.

Anemonefish are omnivorous and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones, and the fecal matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone. Anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column, such as copepods and tunicate larvae, with a small portion of their diet coming from algae, with the exception of Amphiprion perideraion, which primarily feeds on algae.

Anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiotic, mutualistic relationship, each providing many benefits to the other. The individual species are generally highly host specific. The sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles, and functions as a safe nest site. In return, the anemonefish defends the anemone from its predators and parasites. 

The anemone also picks up nutrients from the anemonefish's excrement. The nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts, which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration. The activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone, and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone, which then catches them. Studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as ""wedging"" and ""switching"". Aeration of the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits to the metabolism of both partners, mainly by increasing anemone body size and both anemonefish and anemone respiration.

Anemonefish colonies usually consist of the reproductive male and female and a few male juveniles, which help tend the colony. Although multiple males cohabit an environment with a single female, polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibits reproductive behavior. However, if the female dies, the social hierarchy shifts with the breeding male exhibiting protandrous sex reversal to become the breeding female. The largest juvenile then becomes the new breeding male after a period of rapid growth.

In Disney Pixar's 2003 film Finding Nemo and its 2016 sequel Finding Dory main characters Nemo, his father Marlin, and his mother Coral are clownfish from the species A. ocellaris. The popularity of anemonefish for aquaria increased following the film's release; it is the first film associated with an increase in the numbers of those captured in the wild."
Coelacanth,Up to 200,Up to 90,"Brown, Grey",Up to 60,Carnivore,"Deep-sea, Caves","Sharks, Humans",1.6,Western Indian Ocean,Not Evaluated,Latimeriidae,260-330 million years,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"Coelacanths (order Coelacanthiformes) are an ancient group of lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii) in the class Actinistia. As sarcopterygians, they are more closely related to lungfish and tetrapods (which includes amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) than to ray-finned fish.

Well-represented in both freshwater and marine fossils since the Devonian, they are now represented by only two extant marine species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa, and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). The name coelacanth originates from the Permian genus Coelacanthus, which was the first scientifically named coelacanth. The oldest known coelacanth fossils date back more than 410 million years. Coelacanths were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were discovered living off the coast of South Africa in 1938.

The coelacanth was long considered a ""living fossil"" because scientists thought it was the sole remaining member of a taxon otherwise known only from fossils, with no close relations alive, and that it evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400 million years ago. However, several more recent studies have shown that coelacanth body shapes are much more diverse than previously thought.

Coelacanth locomotion is unique. To move around they most commonly take advantage of up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths generate thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroreception, which aids in movement around obstacles.

Coelacanths are fairly peaceful when encountering others of their kind. They do avoid body contact, however, withdrawing immediately if contact occurs. When approached by foreign potential predators (e.g. a submersible), they show panic flight reactions, suggesting that coelacanths are most likely prey to large deepwater predators. Shark bite marks have been seen on coelacanths; sharks are common in areas inhabited by coelacanths. Population estimates range from 210 individuals per population to 500 per population. Because coelacanths have individual color markings, scientists think that they recognize other coelacanths via electric communication.

Coelacanths are nocturnal piscivores that feed mainly on benthic smaller fish and various cephalopods. They are ""passive drift feeders"", slowly drifting along currents with only minimal self-propulsion, eating whatever prey they encounter. Coelacanths also use their rostral organ for its electroreception to be able to detect nearby prey in low light settings.

The IUCN currently classifies L. chalumnae as ""critically endangered"", with a total population size of 500 or fewer individuals. L. menadoensis is considered Vulnerable, with a significantly larger population size (fewer than 10,000 individuals)."
Common Dolphin,200-250,100-135,"Gray, Yellow",20-25,Carnivore,"Oceans, Coastal Areas","Sharks, Orcas",60,Worldwide,Least Concern,Delphinidae,360-380,60,Group-based,1,"The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a global population of about six million. Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization.

It is presently the only member of the genus Delphinus. The common dolphin belongs to the subfamily Delphininae, making this dolphin closely related to the three different species of bottlenose dolphins, humpback dolphin, striped dolphin, spinner dolphin, Clymene dolphin, spotted dolphin, Fraser's dolphin, the tucuxi and Guiana dolphin. The common dolphin was originally categorized into two different species (now thought to be ecotypes), the short-beaked common dolphin and the long-beaked common dolphin. However, recent evidence has shown that many populations of long-beaked common dolphins around the world are not closely related to one another and are often derived from a short-beaked ancestor and do not always share common derived characteristics. For this reason, they are no longer considered different species.

Common dolphin are medium-sized dolphins; adults range between 1.9 and 2.5 m (6.2 and 8.2 ft) long, and can weigh between 80–235 kg (176–518 lb), although the range between 80–150 kg (180–330 lb) is more common. Males are generally longer and heavier. The color pattern on the body is unusual. The back is dark and the belly is white, while on each side is an hourglass pattern colored light grey, yellow, or gold in front and dirty grey in back. They have long, thin rostra with up to 50–60 small, sharp, interlocking teeth on each side of each jaw.

Common dolphins live in both warm-temperate and tropical waters ranging from 40–60°N to 50°S. Long-beaked common dolphins mostly inhabit shallow, warm coastal water. Short-beaked common dolphins are common ""along shelf edges and in areas with sharp bottom relief such as seamounts and escarpments"". Common dolphins have a varied diet consisting of many species of fish and squid. This includes both mesopelagic species and epipelagic schooling species. They have been recorded to make dives up to 200 metres (660 ft) deep. 

Common dolphins are a widely distributed species. They can be found around the world in both offshore and coastal waters. Common dolphins can live in aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of dolphins. Common dolphins are often seen in groups numbering several hundred individuals (with subgroups consisting of 20–30 individuals). Occasionally, different groups will come together to form mega-pods which can consist of over 10,000 dolphins. ommon dolphin pod structure often consists of nursery pods (which includes females and calves), bachelor pods (consisting of all males) and mixed groups of males and females, including sub-adults and calves. Genetic evidence seems to indicate that common dolphins live in fission-fusion societies, where dolphins form pods that are not necessarily stable and do not necessarily consist of related individuals. It is not known if common dolphins form lifelong bonds with other individuals like the long-term male alliances seen in bottlenose dolphins.

The common dolphin is probably the most abundant cetacean species on the planet, and the overall species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is in no danger of extinction."
Common Snapping Turtle,20-36,4.5-16,"Brown, Gray",30-50,Omnivore,Freshwater,"Birds, Raccoons",Not Applicable,North America,Least Concern,Chelydridae,40-80,Not Applicable,Solitary,20-30,"The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a species of large freshwater turtle in the family Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The present-day Chelydra serpentina population in the Middle Rio Grande suggests that the common snapping turtle has been present in this drainage since at least the seventeenth century and is likely native. The three species of Chelydra and the larger alligator snapping turtles (genus Macrochelys) are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.

The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific epithet serpentina, meaning ""snake-like""). In water, it is likely to flee and hide underwater in sediment. The common snapping turtle has a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and iteroparity (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event.

Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15–20 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.

Common habitats are shallow ponds or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. These sources of water tend to have an abundance of aquatic vegetation due to the shallow pools. Some describe them as habitat generalists as they can occupy most permanent bodies of water. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask—though rarely observed—by floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath. Their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels.

Common snapping turtles are omnivorous. Important aquatic scavengers, they are also active hunters that use ambush tactics to prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, other amphibians, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals. When they encounter a species unfamiliar to them such as humans, in rare instances, they will become curious and survey the situation and even more rarely may bump their nose on a leg of the person standing in the water. Although common snapping turtles have fierce dispositions, when they are encountered in the water or a swimmer approaches, they will slip quietly away from any disturbance or may seek shelter under mud or grass nearby."
Coquerel's Sifaka,40-50,06-Mar,"White, Black",15-18,Herbivore,"Rainforests, Madagascar","Fossa, Hawks",30-45,Madagascar,Endangered,Indriidae,140-160,30,Group-based,1,"Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) is a diurnal, medium-sized lemur of the sifaka genus Propithecus. It is native to northwest Madagascar. Coquerel's sifaka was once considered a subspecies of Verreaux's sifaka but was eventually granted full species status. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and hunting.

In popular culture, the title character in the children's TV show Zoboomafoo is a Coquerel's sifaka. The species was named after French entomologist Charles Coquerel. The dorsal pelage and tail of Coquerel's sifaka are white, and it has maroon patches on the chest and portions of the limbs. The coat is generally dense. Its face is bare and black except for a distinctive patch of white fur along the bridge of the nose. Its naked ears are also black, and its eyes are yellow or orange. The bottom of the lemur's hands and feet are black, while the thighs, arms, and chest are chocolate brown. Like all lemurs, Coquerel's sifaka has a toothcomb, used for grooming and sometimes scraping fruit off a pit.

This species lives at altitudes less than 300 ft (91 m) in the dry deciduous forests of northwestern Madagascar, including coastal forests. It is found from the Betsiboka River up to the Maevarano River, and in large area between these rivers. Extensive surveys of the species' distribution conducted in 2009, 2010, and 2011 led to the confirmation of its presence in most forest fragments between these rivers. Coquerel's sifaka lives in matriarchal groups of about three to ten individuals. It is diurnal and primarily arboreal. Much is known about its behavior from observations in the wild and in captivity. 

This species' herbivorous diet varies by season. In the wet season, it eats immature leaves, flowers, fruit, bark, and dead wood. In the dry season, it eats mature leaves and buds. It may browse nearly 100 plant species, but the majority of its feeding time is concentrated on about 10% of these. Since it has a very fibrous diet, Coquerel's sifaka has an enlarged cecum and extremely long colon that helps facilitate digestion. These lemurs spend 30-40% of their day foraging, especially in the morning, midday, and evening. Females often lead during foraging and exert their dominance by eating the preferred food or denying the males food until they are satisfied. These lemurs are beneficial to the environment because they aid seed dispersion. Captive Coquerel's sifakas eat shining leaf sumac and mimosa.

Coquerel's sifaka is found in only two protected areas in Madagascar, the Ankarafantsika National Park and the Bora Special Reserve. It is a critically endangered species, according to the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species, and it is listed in CITES Appendix I. The principal threats to its existence are deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and hunting pressure. The local people often clear trees to produce new farming land, especially in the marshes where rice can be grown. In northwestern Madagascar, deforestation results from annual burning to create new pastureland for livestock. Trees are also cut for the production of charcoal."
Dalmatian Dog,50-61,23-32,"White, Black",13,Omnivore,Worldwide,"Wolves, Birds of Prey",40-45,Worldwide,Not Applicable,Canidae,63,37,Pack-based,09-Jun,"The Dalmatian is a breed of dog with a white coat marked with dark-coloured spots. Originally bred as a hunting dog, it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia. It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane. Today, it is a popular pet and many enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.

The Dalmatian is a muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina. When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58 cm) tall. Dalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 10 days; however, spots may be visible on their skin from birth. They continue to develop until the dog is around 18 months old. Spots usually range in size from 2 to 6 cm (1.25 to 2.5 in), and are most commonly black or liver (brown) on a white background.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the Dalmatian compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. In their late teens, both males and females may suffer from bone spurs and arthritic conditions. Autoimmune thyroiditis may be a relatively common condition for the breed, affecting 11.6% of dogs.

The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians are not accepted by the breed standard, but these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a dog odour and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.

The roles of this breed are as varied as their reputed ancestors. They were used as hunting dogs, dogs of war, guarding the borders of Dalmatia. To this day, the breed retains a high guarding instinct; although friendly and loyal to those the dog knows and trusts, it is often aloof with strangers and unknown dogs. Dalmatians have a strong hunting instinct and are an excellent exterminator of rats and vermin. In sporting, they have been used as bird dogs, trail hounds, retrievers, or in packs for wild boar or stag hunting. Their dramatic markings and intelligence have made them successful circus dogs throughout the years.

Dalmatians are known for working for firefighters for their role as firefighting apparatus escorts and firehouse mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses are very compatible, the dogs were easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and quickly guide the horses and firefighters to the fires. Dalmatians would also alert the drivers of any upcoming dangers during carriage rides.

The Dalmatian breed experienced a massive surge in popularity as a result of the 1956 novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians written by British author Dodie Smith, and later due to the two Walt Disney films based on the book."
Dhole,50-55,21-Dec,"Red, Brown",15,Carnivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Tigers, Leopards",56,Asia,Endangered,Canidae,60-63,56,Pack-based,08-Apr,"The dhole (Cuon alpinus) is a canid native to South, East and Southeast Asia. It is anatomically distinguished from members of the genus Canis in several aspects: its skull is convex rather than concave in profile, it lacks a third lower molar and the upper molars possess only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four. During the Pleistocene, the dhole ranged throughout Asia, with its range also extending into Europe (with a single record also reported from North America) but became restricted to its historical range 12,000–18,000 years ago. It is now extinct in Central Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, and possibly the Korean peninsula and Russia.

Genetic evidence indicates that the dhole was the result of reticulate evolution, emerging from the hybridization between a species closely related to genus Canis and from a lineage closely related to the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).

The dhole's general tone of the fur is reddish, with the brightest hues occurring in winter. In the winter coat, the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights along the top of the head, neck and shoulders. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured, and are more yellowish in tone. The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle and forehead are greyish-reddish. The tail is very luxuriant and fluffy, and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser and darker. The dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) in length.

Dholes produce whistles resembling the calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, though it is thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark.

The dhole is a highly social animal, living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females. Such clans usually consist of about 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known. Dholes are far less territorial than wolves, with pups from one clan often joining another without trouble once they mature sexually. It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets large and medium-sized ungulates. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with the tiger (Panthera tigris) and the leopard (Panthera pardus), targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.

It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as populations are decreasing and estimated to comprise fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss, loss of prey, competition with other species, persecution due to livestock predation, and disease transfer from domestic dogs."
Dingo,48-58,13-20,"Tan, Brown",15,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Humans, Dingoes",48-64,Australia,Least Concern,Canidae,63,48-64,Group-based,10-Jan,"The dingo (either included in the species Canis familiaris, or considered one of the following independent taxa: Canis familiaris dingo, Canis dingo, or Canis lupus dingo) is an ancient (basal) lineage of dog found in Australia. Its taxonomic classification is debated as indicated by the variety of scientific names presently applied in different publications. It is variously considered a form of domestic dog not warranting recognition as a subspecies, a subspecies of dog or wolf, or a full species in its own right.

The dingo is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colourations are light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull is wedge-shaped and appears large in proportion to the body. The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs, and can be traced back through Maritime Southeast Asia to Asia. The oldest remains of dingoes in Australia are around 3,500 years old.

Compared with the dog, the dingo is able to rotate its wrists and can turn doorknobs or raise latches in order to escape confinement. Dingo shoulder joints are unusually flexible, and they can climb fences, cliffs, trees, and rocks. These adaptations help dingoes climbing in difficult terrain, where they prefer high vantage points. Compared with the skull of the dog, the dingo possesses a longer muzzle, longer carnassial teeth, longer and more slender canine teeth, larger auditory bullae, a flatter cranium with a larger sagittal crest, and larger nuchal lines.

A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year. Like all domestic dogs, dingoes tend towards phonetic communication. However, in contrast to domestic dogs, dingoes howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight sound classes with 19 sound types have been identified.

Dingoes tend to be nocturnal in warmer regions, but less so in cooler areas. Their main period of activity is around dusk and dawn, making them a crepuscular species in the colder climates. The periods of activity are short (often less than 1 hour) with short times of resting. Dingoes have two kinds of movement: a searching movement (apparently associated with hunting) and an exploratory movement (probably for contact and communication with other dogs). According to studies in Queensland, the wild dogs (dingo hybrids) there move freely at night through urban areas and cross streets and seem to get along quite well.

Until 2004, the dingo was categorised as of ""least concern"" on the Red List of Threatened Species. In 2008, it was recategorised as ""vulnerable"", following the decline in numbers to around 30% of ""pure"" dingoes, due to crossbreeding with domestic dogs. In 2018, the IUCN regarded the dingo as a feral dog and discarded it from the Red List."
Dugong,Up to 300,Up to 420,Gray,70-80,Herbivore,"Coastal Waters, Seagrass","Sharks, Orcas",15-Oct,"Indian Ocean, Western Pacific",Vulnerable,Dugongidae,13-14 months,27,Solitary,1,"The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a marine mammal. It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.

The dugong is the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats that support seagrass meadows, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas such as bays, mangrove channels, the waters of large inshore islands and inter-reefal waters. The northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong's contemporary stronghold.

Dugongs are long-lived, and the oldest recorded specimen reached age 73. They have few natural predators, although animals such as crocodiles, killer whales, and sharks pose a threat to the young, and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb. A large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs. Detected pathogens include helminths, cryptosporidium, different types of bacterial infections, and other unidentified parasites. 30% of dugong deaths in Queensland since 1996 are thought to be because of disease.

Although they are social animals, they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations. Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen, but they last only for a short time. Because they are shy and do not approach humans, little is known about dugong behavior.

Like all modern sirenians, the dugong has a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs. The forelimbs or flippers are paddle-like. The dugong is easily distinguishable from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail; moreover, it possesses a unique skull and teeth. Its snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities. The molar teeth are simple and peg-like, unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees.

The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil. Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The dugong's current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction. The IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction, while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species limits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fishing-related fatalities, habitat degradation, and hunting. With its long lifespan of 70 years or more and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction."
Eastern Gorilla,140-188,73-204,Black,40-50,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",40,Democratic Republic of Congo,Endangered,Hominidae,255-270,40,Social groups,1,"The eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) is a critically endangered species of the genus Gorilla and the largest living primate. At present, the species is subdivided into two subspecies. There are 6,800 eastern lowland gorillas or Grauer's gorillas (G. b. graueri) and 1,000 mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei). Illegal hunting threatens the species.

The eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas were previously thought to be two of the three subspecies of one single species, the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). However, genetic research has shown that the two eastern subspecies are far more closely related than the western subspecies: the western lowland gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla), which justified the separate classification. The two eastern subspecies are now classified as G. beringei.

The eastern gorilla is a large hominid with a large head, broad chest, and long arms. It has a flat nose with large nostrils. The face, hands, feet and breast are bald. The fur is mainly black, but adult males have a silvery ""saddle"" on their back. When the gorilla gets older, the hair on the saddle of the back becomes white, much like the gray hair of elderly people. This is why the older males are called silverbacks. Grauer's gorilla has a shorter, thicker, deep black fur, while the mountain gorilla has a more bluish color. Males are much larger than females. A full-grown male eastern gorilla typically weighs 140–205.5 kg (309–453 lb) and stands 1.7 m (5.6 ft) upright and a female typically weighs 90–100 kg (200–220 lb) and stands 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall.

Mountain gorillas are restricted to the mountain rainforest and subalpine forest of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), southwestern Uganda and Rwanda. Grauer's gorilla occur across the forests of the Albertine Rift in eastern DRC. Eastern gorillas are herbivorous, with a heavily foliage based diet, due to lack of available fruit in their habitats. They have smaller home ranges than western gorillas as foliage is more abundant than fruit. They are diurnal but the majority of foraging occurs in the morning and late afternoon. At night, they build nests by folding over vegetation, usually on the ground. 

Eastern gorillas live in stable, cohesive family groups, led by a dominant silverback male. Eastern gorillas tend to have larger group sizes than their western relatives, numbering up to 35 individuals. Males defend their females and offspring using their large size in intimidating displays involving charging and chest-beating.

The eastern gorilla has become increasingly endangered since the 1990s, and the species was listed as critically endangered in September 2016 as its population continued to decrease. Primary threats to the eastern gorilla include habitat destruction for residential, commercial, and agricultural purposes, habitat fragmentation caused by transportation corridors and resource extraction, as well as disease. Between 1996 and 2016, the eastern gorilla lost more than 70 percent of its population, and by 2016 the total population was estimated to be less than 6,000. An exception to this declining trend is the mountain gorilla. According to the most recent estimates, there are approximately 1,004 mountain gorillas, and their numbers continue to grow."
Echidna,30-45,2.5-6.5,"Brown, Tan",15-20,Insectivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Dingoes, Eagles",16-56,"Australia, New Guinea",Least Concern,Tachyglossidae,22-28,16-56,Solitary,1,"Echidnas, sometimes known as spiny anteaters, are quill-covered monotremes (egg-laying mammals) belonging to the family Tachyglossidae living in Australia and New Guinea. The four extant species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the American true anteaters or to hedgehogs. Their young are called puggles.

Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago, descending from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land. Despite their appearance, echidnas are capable swimmers, as they evolved from platypus-like ancestors. When swimming, they expose their snout and some of their spines, and are known to journey to water to bathe.[

Echidnas are medium-sized, solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and spines. The spines are modified hairs and are made of keratin, the same fibrous protein that makes up fur, claws, nails, and horn sheaths in animals. Echidnas have short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Their hind claws are elongated and curved backwards to aid in digging. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws, and feed by tearing open soft logs, anthills and the like, and licking off prey with their long, sticky tongues. The ears are slits on the sides of their heads under the spines. The external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle.

The short-beaked echidna's diet consists mostly of ants and termites, while the Zaglossus (long-beaked) species typically eat worms and insect larvae. The tongues of long-beaked echidnas have sharp, tiny spines that help them capture their prey. They have no teeth, so they break down their food by grinding it between the bottoms of their mouths and their tongues. Like all mammals, echidnas feed their young on milk, which contains various factors to sustain their growth and development.

Echidnas do not tolerate extreme temperatures; they shelter from harsh weather in caves and rock crevices. Echidnas are found in forests and woodlands, hiding under vegetation, roots or piles of debris. They sometimes use the burrows (both abandoned and in use) of animals such as rabbits and wombats. Individual echidnas have large, mutually overlapping territories. Echidnas are very timid. When frightened, they attempt to partially bury themselves and curl into a ball similar to a hedgehog. Strong front arms allow echidnas to dig in and hold fast against a predator pulling them from the hole.

Their many predators include feral cats, foxes, domestic dogs, and goannas. Snakes pose a large threat when they slither into echidna burrows and prey on the spineless young puggles. They are easily stressed and injured by handling. Some ways to help echidnas include picking up litter, causing less pollution, planting vegetation for shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas, and leaving them undisturbed."
Electric Eel,Up to 270,Up to 20,Grayish-brown,15,Carnivore,Amazon Basin,"Crocodiles, Jaguars",Not Applicable,Amazon Basin,Least Concern,Gymnotidae,10 weeks,4.8,Solitary,Thousands,"The electric eels are a genus, Electrophorus, of neotropical freshwater fish from South America in the family Gymnotidae. They are known for their ability to stun their prey by generating electricity, delivering shocks at up to 860 volts. Their electrical capabilities were first studied in 1775, contributing to the invention in 1800 of the electric battery.

Despite their name, electric eels are not closely related to the true eels (Anguilliformes) but are members of the electroreceptive knifefish order, Gymnotiformes. This order is more closely related to catfish. In 2019, electric eels were split into three species: for more than two centuries before that, the genus was believed to be monotypic, containing only Electrophorus electricus.

The three species have largely non-overlapping distributions in the northern part of South America. E. electricus is northern, confined to the Guiana Shield, while E. voltai is southern, ranging from the Brazilian shield northwards; both species live in upland waters. E. varii is central, largely in the lowlands. The lowland region of E. varii is a variable environment, with habitats ranging from streams through grassland and ravines to ponds, and large changes in water level between the wet and dry seasons. All live on muddy river bottoms and sometimes swamps, favouring areas in deep shade. They can tolerate water low in oxygen as they swim to the surface to breathe air.

Electric eels are mostly nocturnal. E. voltai mainly eats fish, in particular the armoured catfish Megalechis thoracata. A specimen of E. voltai had a caecilian (a legless amphibian), Typhlonectes compressicauda, in its stomach; it is possible that this means that the species is resistant to the caecilian's toxic skin secretions. E. voltai sometimes hunts in packs; and have been observed targeting a shoal of tetras, then herding them and launching joint strikes on the closely packed fish. he other species, E. varii, is also a fish predator; it preys especially on Callichthyidae (armoured catfishes) and Cichlidae (cichlids).

Electric eels have long, stout bodies, being somewhat cylindrical at the front but more flattened towards the tail end. The mouth is at the front of the snout, and opens upwards. They have smooth, thick, brown-to-black skin with a yellow or red underbelly and no scales. The pectoral fins each possess eight tiny radial bones at the tip. They have over 100 precaudal vertebrae (excluding the tail), whereas other gymnotids have up to 51 of these; there can be as many as 300 vertebrae in total. There is no clear boundary between the tail fin and the anal fin, which extends much of the length of the body on the underside and has over 400 bony rays. Electric eels rely on the wave-like movements of their elongated anal fin to propel themselves through the water.

Electric eels have small eyes and poor vision. They are capable of hearing via a Weberian apparatus, which consists of tiny bones connecting the inner ear to the swim bladder. All of the vital organs are packed in near the front of the animal, taking up only 20% of space and sequestered from the electric organs. Electric eels can locate their prey using electroreceptors derived from the lateral line organ in the head. The lateral line itself is mechanosensory, enabling them to sense water movements created by animals nearby. The lateral line canals are beneath the skin, but their position is visible as lines of pits on the head."
Emperor Penguin,100,22-45,"Black, White",15-20,Carnivore,Antarctic,Leopard Seals,2-2.5,Antarctica,Near Threatened,Spheniscidae,62-66,9,Colony-based,1,"The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 100 cm (39 in) in length and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). Feathers of the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches.

Like all species of penguin, the emperor is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.

As the species has no fixed nesting sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal sounds alone for identification. They use a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between mates, parents and offspring, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguin species. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.

The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek 50–120 km (31–75 mi) over the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan of an emperor penguin is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live as long as 50 years of age.

In 2012, the emperor penguin was downgraded from a species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN. Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. The primary causes for an increased risk of species endangerment are declining food availability, due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for the species's placement on the Endangered Species Act's list include disease, habitat destruction, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism.

The emperor penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the breeding colony and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March."
Emperor Tamarin,23-26,300-400,"Black, White",15,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Snakes, Hawks",32,Amazon Rainforest,Least Concern,Callitrichidae,140-145,32,Group-based,02-Jan,"The emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator) is a species of tamarin monkey allegedly named for its resemblance to the German emperor Wilhelm II. It lives in the north Brazilian states of Acre and Amazonas and the southwest Amazon Basin, in east Peru, north Bolivia.

The fur of the emperor tamarin is predominantly grey colored, with yellowish speckles on its chest. The hands and feet are black and the tail is brown. Outstanding is its long, white beard, which extends to both sides beyond the shoulders. The animal reaches a length of 23–26 centimetres (9–10 in), plus a 35–41.5 cm (13.8–16.3 in) long tail. It weighs approximately 500 grams (18 oz).

There are claws on each of the animal's toes and fingers, aside from its big toe, which has a nail. While it has a definitive long mustache, it also has almost inconspicuous white hairs on its chin. Visually, however, the saguinus imperator has a black chin. The hair on its chest and belly are a mixture of red, orange, and white hairs. On its back, the fur is dark brown. The inner side of its arms and legs are an orange-like color.

Emperor tamarins behave actively, rapidly, gracefully, gregariously, and playfully in the wild. In captivity the tamarins are very social and interactive with humans. A study by Knox, Kerry L. and Donald Stone Sade of the social behavior of emperor tamarins in captivity found that tamarin colonies behave agonistically according to seniority. There is an agonistic network where each component along a continuum from strongly dominant individuals interaction with strongly subordinate individuals. In the interactions the tamarins usually communicate threat and submission. The aggression is more frequently among individuals of the same sex, most frequently between juvenile males and juvenile males, between juvenile females and juvenile females and also between sexed twins.

There are matrices of within family groups of emperor tamarins where a large proportion of the total number of agonistic interaction within a group occurs between pairs of siblings from different litters. The dynamics of agonistic relations within a group is not just only for the status of the breeding pair but may also influence the allocation of reproductive effort. Family members other than the breeding female may suppress reproduction in adult daughters too. There are certain behaviors that were identified as dominant and some responses as subordinate. The dominant most frequent behaviors happened when the tamarin's mouth is completely opened and show the teeth, when they mount another tamarin or when a tamarin approaches from the rear and encircles another tamarin's waist with both arms. The Subordinate most frequent behaviors are always responses to dominant components and they happened when the subordinate tamarin brings his or her anogenital region into the view of the other tamarin as usually part of a sequence of their body being displayed, when they made a wide-mouth grimace or after they have been mounted they look backward at the dominant tamarin but does not make eye contact. There is always a dominant component toward another tamarin, which immediately responds, with a subordinate component. Long calls and tongue flicking was sometimes part of the agonistic behavior repertoire.

Emperor tamarins are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species of Least Concern, and there are no conservation efforts aimed directly towards this species of primates. Emperor tamarins populations have been in decline due to threats of deforestation and human encroachment. Forest fragmentation has become a huge problem for arboreal primate species in the neotropics: fragmentation causes the tamarins range to be restricted, causing populations to be isolated. Emperor tamarins are located in protected areas in Peru at Manú National Park and Bolivia at Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve. There are no protected areas that overlap with the Brazilian populations of emperor tamarins."
European Hedgehog,14-30,0.6-1.2,"Brown, Spiny",5,Omnivore,"Gardens, Grasslands","Foxes, Badgers",06-Apr,"Europe, Asia",Least Concern,Erinaceidae,35,06-Apr,Solitary,07-Mar,"The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), also known as the West European hedgehog or common hedgehog, is a hedgehog species native to Europe from Iberia and Italy northwards into Scandinavia and westwards into the British Isles. It is a generally common and widely distributed species that can survive across a wide range of habitat types. It is a well-known species, and a favourite in European gardens, both for its endearing appearance and its preference for eating a range of garden pests. While populations are currently stable across much of its range, it is declining severely in Great Britain where it is now Red Listed, meaning that it is considered to be at risk of local extinction. Outside its native range, the species was introduced to New Zealand during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The European hedgehog has a generalised body structure with unspecialised limb girdles. It appears brownish with most of its body covered by up to 6000 brown and white spines. The length of head and body is ~160 mm (6 in) at weaning, increasing to 260 mm (10 in) or more in large adults. It has an extremely short tail as an almost vestigial feature, typically 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to 1.2 in). Males tend to be slightly larger than females, but sex differences in body weight are overshadowed by enormous seasonal variation. 

The European hedgehog is unlike any other creature across most of its range. Where it co-exists with the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus), the two species are difficult to distinguish in the field, the latter having a white spot on its chest. It is probably the largest hedgehog species and is possibly the heaviest member of the order Erinaceomorpha. The European hedgehog is largely nocturnal. It has a hesitant gait, frequently stopping to smell the air. Unlike the smaller, warmer-climate species, the European hedgehog may hibernate in the winter. However, most wake at least once to move their nests.

he European hedgehog is an insectivore. Its diet consists largely of earthworms, as well as snails and slugs, beetles, ants, bees and wasps, earwigs, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers, butterflies and moths, and caterpillars and other insect larvae. Eggs of ground-nesting birds are also taken, and carcasses may be foraged on. Hedgehogs may also eat lizards, snakes, frogs, and small rodents. Plant matter appears to make up only a negligible part of the hedgehog's diet.

This species has become a serious pest in areas where it has been introduced outside of its native range. One such location is the Western Isles of Scotland, where introduced hedgehogs eat the eggs of ground-nesting waders such as common snipe, dunlin, common redshank and northern lapwing. It is also considered a pest in New Zealand where it preys upon various native fauna, including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds. As with many introduced animals, it lacks natural predators."
Fennec Fox,20-40,0.8-1.6,Cream,14,Omnivore,Sahara Desert,"Eagles, Jackals",32,North Africa,Least Concern,Canidae,50-52,32,Solitary,05-Feb,"The Fennec Fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small, nocturnal fox native to the deserts of North Africa, particularly the Sahara Desert, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is the smallest fox species in the world, measuring 24 to 41 centimeters (9 to 16 inches) in body length and weighing only 0.8 to 1.5 kilograms (1.8 to 3.3 pounds). Despite its small size, the fennec fox is highly adapted to the harsh desert environment, making it a fascinating and resilient creature.

One of the most striking features of the fennec fox is its disproportionately large ears, which can grow up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) long. These ears serve multiple purposes: they help dissipate heat to keep the fox cool and provide exceptional hearing, allowing it to detect prey moving underground. Its sandy-colored fur provides effective camouflage in the desert environment while protecting it from the intense heat of the day and the cold temperatures of the night. The thick fur on its feet acts as insulation against the hot sand and aids in silent movement while hunting.

The fennec fox is an omnivore, feeding on a diet that includes insects, small rodents, birds, eggs, and various fruits and plants. It has remarkable water conservation abilities, obtaining most of its hydration from its food, which allows it to survive in areas with scarce water sources. Its foraging behavior is mostly nocturnal, helping it avoid the extreme heat of the day. During the day, fennec foxes retreat to their burrows, which they dig in sand dunes or other soft soil to escape the sun and predators.

Socially, fennec foxes live in small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring. These foxes communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including yips, growls, and purring sounds, as well as through body language and scent marking. Breeding occurs once a year, and after a gestation period of about 50 days, females give birth to a litter of two to five kits. The young are cared for by both parents and remain with the family until they are old enough to fend for themselves.

Although the fennec fox is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it faces threats from habitat destruction due to human expansion and poaching for the exotic pet trade. Despite this, it remains widespread in its native range and has adapted well to its challenging environment.

The fennec fox is not only an essential part of its ecosystem as both predator and prey but also an enduring symbol of desert wildlife. Its unique adaptations, endearing appearance, and ecological importance make it a subject of fascination and admiration worldwide. Protecting its natural habitat is crucial to ensuring the continued survival of this remarkable species."
Fire Salamander,15-25,Up to 55,"Black, Yellow",15,Carnivore,"Forests, Caves","Birds, Foxes",0.8,Europe,Near Threatened,Salamandridae,30-60,0.8,Solitary,Oct-60,"The Fire Salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is one of the most recognizable amphibians in Europe, known for its striking black body with bright yellow or orange markings. This striking coloration serves as a warning to predators, signaling that the fire salamander is toxic. The species is widely distributed across Europe, found in a variety of habitats such as deciduous forests, grasslands, and wetlands. It thrives in temperate regions, preferring cool, moist environments near streams, ponds, or springs where it can find food and breeding grounds.

Fire salamanders are medium-sized amphibians, typically measuring 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) in length, though some individuals can grow larger. Their skin is smooth and has a characteristic glossy appearance, which helps in moisture retention, essential for their survival in damp environments. The bright yellow or orange patterns on their bodies can vary, ranging from spots to stripes, making each salamander visually unique. These vivid markings are a form of aposematism, warning potential predators that the fire salamander is poisonous. The toxins are produced by glands in the skin and can cause irritation or even death if ingested or touched by other animals.

Fire salamanders are nocturnal and spend most of their time on land, though they are closely tied to water for reproduction. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on invertebrates like insects, worms, slugs, and spiders. Their diet varies depending on the availability of prey, but they play an important role in controlling insect populations. Salamanders have a slow, deliberate movement and use their keen sense of smell to locate food, often ambushing prey rather than actively chasing it.

Reproduction occurs during the cooler, wetter months, typically in spring or autumn. Unlike many amphibians that lay eggs in water, fire salamanders give birth to live young. Females typically give birth to a small number of fully formed young, which are capable of independent survival immediately after birth. The young salamanders undergo their metamorphosis inside the mother’s body, emerging as miniature versions of the adults. This reproductive method is a rare trait in amphibians, and the fire salamander is one of the few species to exhibit viviparity (live birth).

Despite their toxic defense mechanisms, fire salamanders face threats from habitat destruction, particularly deforestation and pollution of their water sources. Urbanization, agricultural expansion, and road construction can fragment their populations and disrupt their breeding sites. Additionally, they are vulnerable to diseases, particularly chytrid fungus, which has caused declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Conservation efforts to protect their natural habitats and ensure clean, accessible breeding sites are crucial for maintaining healthy populations of fire salamanders.

The fire salamander is not only an important part of its ecosystem but also a symbol of the unique biodiversity found in Europe’s forests and wetlands. Its striking appearance, combined with its fascinating biology and ecological role, makes it a key species for both wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists. Preserving their habitats ensures the survival of this charismatic amphibian and the delicate ecosystems it inhabits."
Flying Fox,Up to 40,Up to 1.1,"Brown, Gray",15-23,Herbivore,Forests,Birds of Prey,40-50,"Asia, Australia",Least Concern,Pteropodidae,140-150,40-50,Group-based,1,"The Flying Fox is a large fruit bat belonging to the genus Pteropus, and it is one of the largest bat species in the world. Known for their impressive wingspans, which can range from 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet), flying foxes are found in tropical and subtropical regions of South Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and various Pacific islands. They are named for their fox-like faces, which feature large eyes and a sharp snout, and their ability to fly gracefully in the night sky. These bats play an important ecological role as pollinators and seed dispersers, contributing significantly to the health of their habitats.

Flying foxes are easily recognizable by their size and their striking appearance. Their fur is dense and soft, typically brown or reddish, with some species displaying more vibrant shades like yellow or orange. Unlike insectivorous bats, which use echolocation to navigate and hunt, flying foxes rely on their excellent sense of sight and smell to find food, particularly ripe fruits. They are nocturnal creatures, emerging at dusk to feed on a wide range of fruits, including mangoes, bananas, guavas, and figs, as well as flowers and nectar. This diet makes them crucial pollinators for many fruit-bearing trees, as they transfer pollen from one flower to another while feeding.

These bats are highly social animals and live in large colonies, sometimes consisting of thousands of individuals. They roost together in trees during the day, hanging upside down in clusters. Their colonies can be noisy, with individuals communicating using a variety of vocalizations, such as squawks, clicks, and whistles. The roosting sites are typically located in dense forests or near fruiting trees, where food is abundant. Flying foxes are not territorial, and their roosts are often shared by multiple colonies of different species. At night, they travel long distances to forage, sometimes covering up to 50 kilometers (31 miles) in search of food.

Reproduction in flying foxes usually takes place once a year. After a gestation period of about five to six months, females give birth to a single pup. The young are dependent on their mothers for nourishment and care, staying close to the roost until they are old enough to fly and forage on their own. Flying foxes typically live for 10 to 20 years in the wild, although they face numerous threats from human activities and environmental changes.

Flying foxes are considered ""keystone species"" because of their role in pollination and seed dispersal, which helps to maintain the biodiversity of their ecosystems. They are especially important in the regeneration of tropical forests and in the dispersal of seeds from the fruits they eat, contributing to the growth of new plants and trees. Despite the challenges they face, conservation efforts are underway to protect flying fox populations by preserving their natural habitats, regulating hunting practices, and educating the public about their ecological importance.

In conclusion, flying foxes are remarkable creatures whose ecological roles as pollinators and seed dispersers are vital to the health of many tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Their large size, social behaviors, and distinctive feeding habits make them fascinating animals, but they also face numerous threats. Protecting these incredible bats is essential not only for their survival but for the preservation of the ecosystems they support."
Fossa,70-90,08-May,"Brown, Reddish-brown",15-20,Carnivore,"Rainforests, Madagascar","Humans, Larger Predators",45-48,Madagascar,Vulnerable,Eupleridae,90,45-48,Solitary,04-Feb,"The Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) is a carnivorous mammal native to Madagascar, where it occupies the role of the island's top predator. Despite its cat-like appearance, the fossa is more closely related to mongooses and civets, belonging to the family Eupleridae, a group of carnivores unique to Madagascar. The fossa is a remarkable and elusive animal, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of Madagascar’s delicate ecosystem. It is the largest predator on the island, measuring between 60 to 80 centimeters (24 to 31 inches) in body length, with males generally larger than females. Its tail, which can be up to 70 centimeters (27 inches) long, provides balance as it climbs and leaps through the trees in search of prey.

Fossas have a sleek, muscular body built for agility and speed. Their coat is typically short, with a reddish-brown or grayish color that blends well with the forested habitats they occupy. They have long, flexible limbs and semi-retractable claws that enable them to climb trees with ease, making them both terrestrial and arboreal hunters. Fossas are often compared to cats in their physical structure, particularly in the way they hunt, but their behavior and lineage are more similar to that of mongooses.

As a carnivore, the fossa's diet primarily consists of lemurs, but it also preys on birds, reptiles, and other small mammals. It is an opportunistic hunter, taking advantage of whatever prey is available. Fossas are known to be very stealthy, using their keen senses of sight, smell, and hearing to locate their prey. They are solitary animals, hunting alone, and their agility and strength allow them to take down prey much larger than themselves. Fossas are also known to be excellent climbers and leapers, navigating the dense forest canopy with great skill to capture prey.

Fossas are primarily solitary animals, coming together only for mating. They have a unique and sometimes aggressive mating behavior, with multiple males vying for the attention of a single female. The mating season typically occurs between October and December, with the females selecting the dominant males. After a gestation period of about three months, the female gives birth to a litter of two to four pups. The young remain with their mother for up to two years, learning the essential skills needed to survive in the wild, including hunting and territory marking. These young fossas are highly dependent on their mother's care during the early stages of their lives.

Fossas are currently classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with their populations declining due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict. The primary threat to their survival is the destruction of their natural habitat, as Madagascar’s forests are being cleared for agriculture and logging. Additionally, the introduction of invasive species, such as dogs and rats, has increased competition for food and introduced new predators, further threatening the fossa's survival. Hunting, particularly for bushmeat, also poses a significant risk to fossa populations.

Despite these threats, the fossa plays a critical role in its ecosystem as an apex predator. By controlling the populations of smaller mammals, birds, and reptiles, the fossa helps maintain the balance of the ecosystems in which it lives. The loss of the fossa could lead to an imbalance in the populations of its prey species, potentially disrupting the entire food chain. Conservation efforts are crucial for protecting the fossa and its habitat, with a focus on preserving Madagascar’s forests, regulating hunting, and controlling invasive species.

In conclusion, the fossa is a fascinating and unique predator that plays a vital role in the ecology of Madagascar. Its elusive nature, agility, and hunting prowess make it a remarkable species, but it faces significant challenges due to habitat destruction and human interference. Protecting the fossa and its forest habitat is essential for maintaining the biodiversity of Madagascar’s fragile ecosystems and ensuring the survival of this remarkable carnivore."
Frilled Lizard,Up to 90,Up to 0.5,"Brown, Grey",15,"Insectivore, Herbivore",Northern Australia,"Birds, Dingoes",29,Northern Australia,Least Concern,Agamidae,43-49,29,Solitary,25-Jun,"The Frilled Lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii) is a remarkable reptile native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is best known for its large, frill-like structure of skin around its neck, which it uses as a defense mechanism. This lizard typically measures up to 85 centimeters (33 inches) in length, with much of its size attributed to its long tail. Its body coloration ranges from gray to brown, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the dry forests, woodlands, and savanna regions it inhabits. Despite its terrestrial capabilities, the frilled lizard is primarily arboreal, spending much of its time in trees.

One of the most striking features of the frilled lizard is its namesake frill. This fold of skin, supported by long cartilage spines, remains folded against its body when relaxed. However, when threatened, the lizard dramatically unfurls its frill, which can span nearly its entire body width, displaying vibrant colors such as orange, yellow, or red. Accompanied by a wide-open mouth and hissing, this display is meant to intimidate predators. If the threat persists, the lizard often resorts to flight, sprinting upright on its hind legs, with its tail extended for balance—a behavior that adds to its fascinating reputation.

The frilled lizard is primarily insectivorous, feeding on ants, termites, beetles, and other invertebrates, although it occasionally preys on small vertebrates like frogs or other lizards. It is an important predator in its ecosystem, helping to control insect populations. Active during the day, the frilled lizard spends its time foraging or basking in the sun, relying on its sharp senses to detect food and potential threats.

Reproduction in frilled lizards aligns with the wet season, when food is abundant. Females lay between 8 and 23 eggs in a burrow dug into the soil, leaving them to incubate for about two to three months. Upon hatching, the young are fully independent and capable of fending for themselves. Their survival depends on their ability to evade predators and locate food, as they face the same challenges as adults.

Currently, the frilled lizard is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, as it maintains stable populations across its range. However, habitat loss and climate change could pose risks in the future. Beyond its ecological role, the frilled lizard is a cultural icon in Australia, often featured in media, coins, and stamps due to its dramatic appearance and unique behaviors.

Galápagos Penguin,49-53,1.5-2.5,"Black, White",Up to 15,Carnivore,Coastal Areas,"Orcas, Sharks",24-35,GalÃƒÂ¡pagos Islands,Endangered,Spheniscidae,40,24-35,Solitary,1,"The Galápagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) is a small species of penguin found exclusively on the Galápagos Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador. It is the only penguin species that lives north of the equator, making it a unique and fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation. The Galápagos penguin is also one of the smallest penguin species, typically reaching about 49 to 56 centimeters (19 to 22 inches) in height and weighing between 1.5 to 2.5 kilograms (3.3 to 5.5 pounds). Despite their small size, they are highly adapted to the hot, equatorial climate of the Galápagos, a region far warmer than most penguin habitats.

One of the most distinctive features of the Galápagos penguin is its ability to thrive in an environment that is not traditionally associated with penguins, which are typically found in colder regions. These penguins have adapted to the warmer temperatures through various behavioral and physiological traits. Unlike other penguin species that breed in colder climates, the Galápagos penguin can regulate its body temperature by seeking shade, swimming in cold ocean currents, and using behavioral adaptations like panting. During the hotter months, they often rest in the shade or swim in the cooler waters of the deeper ocean channels.

Galápagos penguins are excellent swimmers and divers, using their wings to propel themselves through the water in a manner similar to flying. They primarily feed on small fish such as sardines, anchovies, and other small marine organisms. They hunt by diving to depths of up to 30 meters (98 feet) and using their strong swimming abilities to chase and capture their prey. Their hunting is highly dependent on the availability of food, which can fluctuate with the seasons and oceanic conditions, such as the El Niño phenomenon, which can significantly impact their food supply and breeding success.

Breeding in Galápagos penguins occurs year-round, with peaks during the cooler months of the year when food is more abundant. They typically nest in caves, crevices, or under rocks along the coastline, where they are protected from the heat and predators. These penguins are monogamous and often form long-term pair bonds. During the breeding season, females lay one or two eggs, which both parents take turns incubating. After about 38 days, the eggs hatch, and the parents share the responsibility of feeding and protecting the chicks. The chicks are fed regurgitated food and are cared for by both parents until they are old enough to fend for themselves.

The Galápagos penguin faces several challenges to its survival, with its population fluctuating due to environmental factors and human activities. The species has a small population, estimated at only around 1,000 individuals in the wild, making it vulnerable to extinction. Climate change, particularly the effects of El Niño events, can cause dramatic shifts in food availability, which directly impacts the penguins' breeding success and survival rates. The warming of ocean waters during these events can lead to a decrease in the availability of the small fish that the penguins rely on for food. Additionally, introduced predators like rats, cats, and dogs, as well as habitat destruction due to human development and tourism, pose threats to the penguin's nesting sites and safety.

Conservation efforts are essential for the survival of the Galápagos penguin. The Galápagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation have implemented programs to monitor penguin populations and protect their habitats. These efforts include controlling invasive species, protecting nesting areas, and studying the impacts of climate change on the penguin’s food sources. Because of its limited range and vulnerability to environmental changes, the Galápagos penguin is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

In conclusion, the Galápagos penguin is a unique and resilient species that has adapted to live in the warm equatorial waters of the Galápagos Islands. It faces numerous threats, including climate change, food scarcity, and predation, but conservation efforts are underway to protect this remarkable penguin. The Galápagos penguin’s survival depends on continued research, habitat protection, and global efforts to combat climate change, ensuring that this rare species remains a living symbol of the extraordinary biodiversity of the Galápagos Islands."
Galápagos Tortoise,Up to 183,Up to 417,"Brown, Grey",100-150,Herbivore,GalÃ¡pagos Islands,"Humans, Rats",0.3-0.5,GalÃ¡pagos Islands,Vulnerable,Testudinidae,135,0.3,Solitary,Up to 16,"The Galápagos Tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) is one of the most iconic and well-known species native to the Galápagos Islands, an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador. Famous for their large size, longevity, and distinctive shell shapes, Galápagos tortoises are a symbol of the island's unique biodiversity. These tortoises are among the largest living species of tortoise, with some individuals weighing over 400 kilograms (880 pounds) and reaching lengths of up to 1.5 meters (5 feet). The Galápagos tortoise is a slow-moving herbivore, known for its gentle demeanor and its ability to live for over 100 years, making it one of the longest-living animals on Earth.

One of the most notable features of the Galápagos tortoise is the shape of its shell, which varies depending on the subspecies and the island it inhabits. There are two main types of shells: the dome-shaped shell, which is characteristic of tortoises from islands with abundant vegetation, and the saddle-backed shell, which is found in tortoises from drier islands. The saddle-backed shell has a raised front section that allows the tortoise to stretch its neck further to reach high vegetation, a critical adaptation for surviving in areas where food is scarcer. These adaptations are key to their survival on the diverse islands of the Galápagos.

Galápagos tortoises are herbivores and graze on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, fruit, and cactus pads. They have powerful jaws and a keen ability to forage for food, spending much of their day grazing. Their slow metabolism and ability to go without food for long periods have helped them survive in the harsh and often resource-scarce environment of the Galápagos Islands. Their diet also varies with the seasons, as different plant species are available at different times of the year, and they are known to be particularly fond of the prickly pear cactus, which provides both food and moisture.

Reproduction in Galápagos tortoises is a slow process. Mating typically occurs during the wet season, and after a courtship display, the male will mate with a female, sometimes engaging in long periods of copulation. The female lays between 2 and 16 eggs, depending on her size, in a burrow she digs in the soil. The eggs incubate for about 120 to 160 days, and once the hatchlings emerge, they are left to fend for themselves. The young tortoises are vulnerable to predators, such as rats, dogs, and cats, which were introduced to the islands by humans, as well as to environmental factors. However, they grow slowly and begin to reproduce only when they are around 20 years old.

Historically, the Galápagos tortoise population was significantly impacted by human activity. The introduction of invasive species, such as rats, pigs, and goats, posed severe threats to their eggs and young tortoises, while overhunting for their meat by sailors and whalers in the 18th and 19th centuries decimated their populations. As a result, many subspecies of Galápagos tortoises became critically endangered or extinct. Conservation efforts have been underway for many decades to protect these tortoises, and programs to remove invasive species, protect nesting sites, and breed tortoises in captivity have helped boost population numbers.

The Galápagos tortoise is currently classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with some subspecies still facing the threat of extinction. Conservation programs, such as the breeding and restoration projects led by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galápagos National Park, have been successful in increasing tortoise numbers. These efforts have also included habitat restoration, education programs to reduce human impact, and the release of captive-bred tortoises into the wild."
Galliformes,Varies,Varies,Varies,Varies,Omnivore,Varies,Varies,Varies,Worldwide,Varies,Phasianidae,Varies,Varies,Varies,Varies,"Galliformes is an order of heavy-bodied, ground-dwelling birds, which includes some of the most well-known and widely distributed species in the world, such as pheasants, turkeys, quails, grouse, and chickens. Members of the Galliformes are primarily terrestrial, with strong legs and relatively short wings, adapted for walking and running rather than flying. They are mostly found in forests, grasslands, and other open habitats, where they forage for seeds, fruits, and small insects. The order contains approximately 300 species across over 30 genera, and while they are found on every continent except Antarctica, they are most abundant in tropical and temperate regions.

One of the defining characteristics of Galliformes is their sturdy, muscular legs, which are adapted for running and scratching the ground in search of food. These birds generally have short, rounded wings and are not strong fliers, though they can burst into flight if threatened. Their flight is typically low and short, used mainly to escape predators. Galliformes also have a strong, often beak-like bill adapted to their herbivorous or omnivorous diets. Their diet mainly consists of seeds, grains, fruits, and in some cases, insects or small animals.

Galliformes are notable for their sexual dimorphism, with males often being more colorful and displaying elaborate plumage and calls to attract females during the breeding season. Species like the peacock, a member of the pheasant family, are famous for their elaborate and brightly colored tail feathers that are displayed in a fan during courtship. In contrast, the females tend to have more subdued coloring, which helps them blend into their environment, especially during nesting. The males of some species, like turkeys and grouse, also perform complex courtship displays, including drumming, dancing, and vocalizations.

Galliformes have been of significant economic importance to humans for thousands of years. Domesticated species like the chicken (Gallus gallus) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) are among the most commonly raised poultry for meat and eggs worldwide. Additionally, many species, including pheasants, quail, and grouse, are hunted for sport and for their meat. The domestication of the chicken has had a profound impact on human society, providing a reliable food source that has been integral to agricultural systems globally.

The order Galliformes is divided into several families, including Phasianidae (pheasants, chickens, and turkeys), Odontophoridae (New World quails), and Tetraonidae (grouse), among others. Each family has evolved distinct behaviors and ecological niches, contributing to the diversity of this bird order. For instance, pheasants are typically larger and more brightly colored, while quails are smaller, more cryptic, and often found in larger groups. Grouse, on the other hand, are known for their elaborate mating displays and are often associated with colder, more northern habitats.

In conclusion, Galliformes are a diverse and ecologically important order of birds that have adapted to a wide range of habitats and are integral to ecosystems as foragers and prey species. Their economic value, both in terms of food production and hunting, is immense, and their cultural significance stretches back through history. Despite the challenges some species face, efforts to conserve their populations help ensure that these iconic birds continue to thrive in the wild."
Gaur,180-300,600-1300,"Dark Brown, Black",20-25,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Tigers, Leopards",30-40,"Southeast Asia, South Asia",Vulnerable,Bovidae,275-280,30-40,Herd-based,1,"The Gaur (Bos gaurus), also known as the Indian bison, is a large wild cattle species native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is one of the largest species of wild cattle in the world, with males standing up to 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) tall at the shoulder and weighing between 900 to 1,500 kilograms (2,000 to 3,300 pounds), while females are smaller. Gaurs have muscular, sturdy bodies with a distinctive hump over their shoulders, large curved horns, and short, dark brown to black coats. Their long, muscular legs and broad chest give them a robust appearance. Their horns can reach lengths of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) and are used for defense, dominance displays, and in territorial conflicts with other males.

The gaurs are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, shrubs, fruits, and the leaves of trees. They are typically found in forested regions, including tropical rainforests, grasslands, and hill forests, from the Himalayan foothills to central and southern India, and across Southeast Asia to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. These animals are browsers and grazers, and they play an important role in the ecosystems they inhabit by influencing the vegetation structure. Their large size allows them to consume large amounts of vegetation, shaping plant communities in their territories.

Gaurs are typically found in small herds, which are usually led by an older female, and may consist of up to 20 individuals, although larger groups can form in areas where food is abundant. Male gaurs are solitary or form small bachelor groups, and they tend to be more aggressive and territorial, especially during the mating season. The gaurs’ social structure is matriarchal, with females and young calves forming the core of the herd. Herds move together in search of food and water, and their large size and powerful build make them capable of defending themselves from most predators. The primary predators of gaurs are tigers, leopards, and wild dogs, though adult gaurs are too large and powerful for most predators to take down easily.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the gaur as Vulnerable, and the species is protected in many parts of its range, particularly within national parks, wildlife reserves, and protected forest areas. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and managing populations of domestic livestock to prevent disease transmission. In some areas, conservationists are working to ensure that the local human communities are involved in protecting the gaurs and their habitats, providing them with an economic incentive through ecotourism.

In conclusion, the gaur is a magnificent and important species that plays a significant ecological role in its habitat. As a large herbivore, it helps maintain the balance of vegetation in forests and grasslands across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. While the species faces numerous threats, continued conservation efforts aimed at protecting its habitats and reducing human-wildlife conflict are crucial to ensuring that the gaur survives in the wild for future generations."
Gerenuk,80-105,28-52,"Brown, White",10,Herbivore,"Savannas, Scrublands","Lions, Leopards",55,"Eastern Africa, Horn of Africa",Near Threatened,Bovidae,170-215,95,Solitary,1,"The Gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) is a distinctive species of antelope found in the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa, particularly in parts of Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Known for its slender body and long neck, the gerenuk is sometimes referred to as the ""Giraffe Gazelle"" due to its giraffe-like neck. It is a medium-sized antelope, typically standing about 90 cm (35 inches) tall at the shoulder and weighing between 35 to 55 kilograms (77 to 121 pounds). Gerenuks have large, expressive eyes, a small head, and elegant, slender legs, with males displaying longer, more twisted horns, which are used in territorial disputes and dominance displays.

One of the most striking features of the gerenuk is its remarkable ability to stand on its hind legs, a behavior that allows it to browse on shrubs and trees that are out of reach for other herbivores. This unique feeding behavior is an adaptation to the often sparse vegetation in its dry habitat, where food sources are not abundant. By standing on its hind legs, the gerenuk can reach branches that other grazing animals cannot, giving it access to leaves, fruits, and shoots that are essential to its diet. Gerenuks are primarily browsers, though they may also feed on grasses when available, and they are particularly adept at foraging in the thorny bushes and acacia trees that dominate their environments.

Reproduction in gerenuks follows the typical pattern for many antelopes, with females giving birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about seven months. The calves are born with their eyes open and are able to stand and walk within a few hours of birth, though they remain hidden in dense vegetation for protection in the early stages of life. The mother provides the primary care for the calf, which stays close to her for the first few months, gradually becoming more independent as it learns to forage on its own. Gerenuks generally breed year-round, but births are often timed to coincide with periods of food abundance, when the mother can ensure the best chance of survival for her offspring.

Gerenuks are adapted to living in the dry, open savannas and bushlands of East Africa, where they must cope with the extreme heat and scarcity of water. They are highly adapted to conserving moisture and can go for long periods without drinking, obtaining most of their water needs from the plants they consume. This remarkable ability to thrive in such challenging environments makes them well-suited to their habitats, but it also means they are vulnerable to changes in their environment. Droughts, habitat destruction due to human encroachment, and competition with livestock for food and water have put significant pressure on gerenuk populations in some regions.

Conservation efforts for the gerenuk focus on preserving its natural habitat, creating protected areas, and reducing human-wildlife conflict. In regions where the gerenuk coexists with human populations, community-based conservation programs are helping to raise awareness and reduce poaching. The species is also found in several protected areas and national parks, where its numbers are monitored, and steps are taken to ensure that it continues to thrive.

In conclusion, the gerenuk is a fascinating and uniquely adapted antelope that plays an important role in the ecosystems of East Africa. Its ability to browse on shrubs and trees gives it a distinct ecological niche, and its elegant form and behavior make it an iconic species in the region. While the gerenuk faces ongoing threats, continued conservation efforts will be vital to preserving this remarkable animal for future generations."
Gharial,Up to 600,Up to 1500,Brownish-gray,40-60,Carnivore,"Rivers, Lakes","Crocodiles, Tigers",32,Indian subcontinent,Critically Endangered,Gavialidae,94-123,32,Solitary,20-95,"The Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is a large species of crocodilian found primarily in the river systems of the Indian subcontinent, notably in parts of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Known for its distinctive, long, narrow snout, the gharial is one of the most specialized members of the crocodile family. This unique snout, which is filled with sharp teeth, is adapted for catching fish, its primary diet. Gharials are considered to be the most aquatic of the crocodilian species, spending almost all of their time in the water, particularly in fast-moving rivers with sandy or muddy banks, where they can easily hunt and bask in the sun.

Adult male gharials are particularly noticeable due to the bulbous growth on the end of their snouts, called a ghara (a Hindi word for ""pot""), which resembles an earthen pot. This structure is thought to play a role in vocalization and courtship displays. The gharial's body is elongated, with a streamlined shape and long tail that helps it maneuver efficiently in water. Their legs are relatively short, and they use them to propel themselves through the water, relying more on their long, powerful tail for swimming. Despite their size—males can grow up to 6 meters (20 feet) in length—gharials are generally not a threat to humans due to their specialized diet and behavior. Instead of preying on large animals, they focus on fish, using their snout to catch prey with remarkable precision.

The gharial's diet primarily consists of fish, which it catches by snapping its long, tooth-filled jaws with great speed. Unlike other crocodilians that are opportunistic predators and can hunt on land or water, gharials have evolved to specialize in fish-catching, and they are rarely seen hunting terrestrial prey. Their narrow, elongated snouts are lined with sharp teeth, making them ideal for grasping slippery fish. Gharials typically hunt in the deeper sections of rivers, where they can remain submerged for long periods before emerging to grab fish from the surface or mid-water. The Gharial is critically endangered, and its population has dwindled dramatically over the past century. Once widespread throughout the Indian subcontinent, the gharial’s numbers have sharply decreased due to habitat destruction, pollution, poaching, and human encroachment on river systems. Dams, irrigation projects, and excessive sand mining have altered the natural flow of rivers, disrupting the gharial's habitat and food supply. The construction of reservoirs and dams has also isolated gharial populations, preventing genetic diversity and reducing the available space for breeding. Additionally, gharials are often unintentionally caught in fishing nets or killed by boat propellers, further threatening their survival.In conclusion, the gharial is a highly specialized and fascinating crocodilian species that plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystems of the Indian subcontinent. Its long, narrow snout and fish-eating habits make it an iconic member of the crocodile family. However, due to the loss of suitable habitat, human-induced threats, and the species' low reproductive rate, the gharial is critically endangered. Ongoing conservation efforts are essential to ensure that this remarkable species survives in the wild and continues to contribute to the biodiversity of river ecosystems in South Asia."
Giant Pacific Octopus,Up to 5,Up to 25,"Red, Brown",5,Carnivore,Ocean Floor,"Fish, Sharks",24,Pacific Ocean,Data Deficient,Enteroctopodidae,50-70,24,Solitary,"Up to 200,000","The Giant Pacific Octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) is the largest species of octopus, known for its impressive size, intelligence, and adaptability. Native to the coastal waters of the North Pacific Ocean, it is found along the coastlines of the eastern Pacific, including areas around Alaska, British Columbia, and parts of California. Adult giant Pacific octopuses can grow up to 4.3 meters (14 feet) in length, including their tentacles, and weigh as much as 50 kilograms (110 pounds), though most are considerably smaller. Their soft, gelatinous bodies and eight long arms, lined with suckers, enable them to fit into tight crevices and make them incredibly versatile hunters and escape artists.

One of the defining features of the giant Pacific octopus is its remarkable ability to camouflage. Like all octopuses, it possesses specialized skin cells called chromatophores, which contain pigments that allow it to change color and pattern in response to its surroundings. This camouflaging ability helps it evade predators, such as larger fish, sea otters, and sharks, and allows it to ambush prey more effectively. The octopus's skin also contains iridophores and leucophores, which reflect and refract light, adding to its ability to blend into complex environments like rocky reefs, kelp forests, and seafloor habitats. This camouflage can shift rapidly in response to both external stimuli and its internal mood, making the giant Pacific octopus a master of disguise.

The diet of the giant Pacific octopus primarily consists of crabs, shrimp, clams, snails, and fish. It is a carnivorous predator that uses its intelligence and dexterity to capture prey. The octopus has excellent vision, which aids in locating its food. Once it has identified a target, the giant Pacific octopus uses its powerful arms and suckers to grasp and subdue the prey. In some cases, it will use its sharp beak to break into shells or exoskeletons, making access to the soft flesh of its prey easier. When hunting, the octopus relies on its flexibility to sneak up on prey or navigate complex underwater environments with ease. It can squeeze through incredibly small gaps, allowing it to escape from predators and pursue its prey into tight spaces.

The giant Pacific octopus is highly intelligent, exhibiting problem-solving abilities and behaviors indicative of complex cognitive functions. Studies have shown that they are capable of using tools, such as collecting coconut shells to create shelters, and can navigate mazes or manipulate objects to achieve specific goals. This intelligence is supported by their large brains relative to their body size and the advanced neural network they have in each arm, allowing for independent control of each limb. Their behavior also suggests that they are capable of learning and adapting based on experience, which makes them exceptional hunters and survivors in their environment.

Reproduction in giant Pacific octopuses is a complex process that occurs once a female has reached maturity, typically around 3 to 5 years of age. Mating occurs when males use a specialized arm, called a hectocotylus, to transfer spermatophores (packets of sperm) to the female. After mating, the female lays thousands of eggs, which she guards and tends to, typically in a den or sheltered location. She remains with the eggs, continuously aerating and cleaning them to ensure their survival. During this period, the female does not eat, and she eventually dies after the eggs hatch, which is part of the species' semelparity (a reproductive strategy where an individual dies after a single reproductive event). The hatchlings, which are planktonic at first, go through a juvenile phase before growing into adults. In conclusion, the giant Pacific octopus is an extraordinary creature that exemplifies the incredible adaptability and intelligence of cephalopods. Its ability to camouflage, manipulate its environment, and use its advanced problem-solving skills makes it one of the most fascinating marine animals. As a predator, it plays a crucial role in regulating the populations of other marine species, and its life cycle highlights the balance between survival, reproduction, and the transient nature of life in the ocean. Conservation efforts focused on protecting marine habitats and ensuring sustainable fishing practices will be vital to maintaining healthy populations of this remarkable species."
Giant Panda,70-90,70-125,"Black, White",20-30,Herbivore,Temperate Broadleaf Forests,Snow Leopards,32,China,Endangered,Ursidae,95-160,32,Solitary,1,"The Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is one of the most iconic and beloved species in the animal kingdom, renowned for its distinctive black and white fur and its gentle, solitary nature. Native to China, the giant panda is primarily found in the mountain ranges of central China, including Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. It inhabits temperate forests with dense bamboo understories, where it can find its main food source—bamboo. The giant panda’s status as a symbol of wildlife conservation is largely due to its endangered status and the global efforts to preserve its population.

Adult giant pandas are large and robust animals, with males weighing between 85 and 125 kilograms (187 to 276 pounds) and females being slightly smaller. They have round faces with black patches around their eyes, ears, and across their limbs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Despite their somewhat bear-like features, pandas are members of the Ursidae family, sharing a common ancestor with other bears like brown bears and polar bears. Their thick, woolly fur provides insulation against the cold mountain climate, and they have powerful jaws and strong teeth capable of crushing bamboo stalks, which make up over 99% of their diet.

Despite their slow and methodical lifestyle, pandas have a solitary nature and are mostly active during dawn and dusk, spending much of their time eating or resting. They do not hibernate like some other bear species, but rather, they remain active throughout the year, adjusting their foraging habits depending on the availability of bamboo. Pandas communicate with one another through vocalizations, scent marking, and body language, especially during the mating season when females may seek out males and males compete for mates. However, pandas are not social animals and prefer to live alone, with each adult maintaining a home range that it defends from other pandas.

Breeding in giant pandas is notoriously difficult, both in the wild and in captivity. Females are only in estrus (the period when they can conceive) for a short window of 2 to 3 days once a year, making it challenging for males to successfully mate with them. After mating, the female gives birth to a single cub, although twins occasionally occur. Cubs are born extremely small, weighing about the size of a stick of butter, which is about 1/900th of the mother’s body weight. The mother cares for the cub intensively, feeding it with her milk and protecting it from predators. Cubs are helpless at birth, unable to open their eyes and completely dependent on the mother for warmth and nutrition. They stay with their mothers for up to 18 months before becoming more independent. Pandas typically only reproduce once every two years due to the lengthy maternal care required and the short breeding season.

The giant panda has faced significant threats to its survival over the years, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation. As China’s population grew and its agricultural and industrial sectors expanded, the pandas’ bamboo forests were cleared for farming and development. Climate change also threatens the panda’s habitat, as warmer temperatures could alter the distribution of bamboo forests and reduce their availability. Additionally, while pandas have few natural predators, the loss of suitable habitats and limited food sources has contributed to their endangered status.

The giant panda has made a remarkable recovery, and as of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) officially downgraded its status from Endangered to Vulnerable, thanks to successful conservation efforts. However, the species still faces ongoing challenges, such as the need to maintain and expand suitable habitats and reduce human-wildlife conflict. The giant panda remains a powerful symbol of conservation, demonstrating how coordinated efforts, government support, and international collaboration can help protect a species from the brink of extinction.

In conclusion, the giant panda is not only a symbol of the biodiversity of China but also of the broader global effort to protect endangered species. Its reliance on bamboo, solitary nature, and slow reproductive rate make it vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes. However, through dedicated conservation programs, the panda's population has stabilized, giving hope for its future. With continued efforts to protect its habitat and ensure genetic diversity, the giant panda may continue to thrive in the wild for future generations."
Gila Monster,Up to 60,Up to 2.3,"Black, Orange",Up to 20,Carnivore,"Deserts, Scrubland","Birds of Prey, Coyotes",02-Jan,"Southwestern United States, Mexico",Least Concern,Helodermatidae,120-150,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"The Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum) is one of only two venomous lizard species in the world, the other being the Mexican beaded lizard. Found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, the Gila monster primarily inhabits arid and semi-arid regions, including deserts, scrublands, and dry forests. Its range includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and California, as well as areas in Sonora and Sinaloa in Mexico. The Gila monster is most commonly found in rocky hillsides, canyons, and the bases of shrubs or cactus plants, where it can take shelter from the extreme desert heat.

Gila monsters are relatively large for lizards, growing to lengths of up to 60 cm (24 inches) and weighing about 1 to 2 kilograms (2 to 4 pounds). They have a distinctive appearance, with thick, scaly skin covered in bead-like tubercles, which gives them a rough, textured surface. Their skin is typically a combination of black with orange or pinkish markings, providing them with some camouflage in their desert environment. Despite their relatively slow movements, Gila monsters have a powerful bite, and they are well known for their venomous capabilities, which they use primarily for defense and hunting.

The Gila monster's venom is delivered through grooves in its teeth, located in the lower jaw. When it bites, the venom seeps from these grooves into the wound, delivering a potent mix of neurotoxins and enzymes that can cause severe pain, swelling, and even paralysis in small prey animals. While not typically a threat to humans, the venom is dangerous, though fatalities are rare. Gila monsters generally use their venom to subdue and immobilize their prey, which consists of small mammals, birds, eggs, and insects. They have relatively low metabolic rates and can go for extended periods without food, sometimes even several weeks or months. During periods of fasting, they rely on fat stored in their tails, which can be up to a third of their body mass, to sustain themselves.

Despite their fearsome appearance and venomous nature, Gila monsters are not aggressive and will generally only bite if threatened or provoked. They are a protected species in several states due to their declining numbers, primarily because of habitat destruction, illegal collection, and road mortality. Human encroachment into their desert habitats, including urban development and agriculture, has reduced the availability of suitable shelter and food sources. Conservation efforts have been put in place to protect their habitats, and they are now listed as a species of ""Least Concern"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though they are still vulnerable to localized threats.

In addition to their physical and behavioral adaptations, Gila monsters have also become valuable in scientific research due to their venom. Scientists have explored the properties of Gila monster venom for potential medical applications, particularly in the development of drugs for diabetes. The venom contains a compound known as exendin-4, which can regulate insulin secretion in the body, making it an area of interest in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The potential benefits of this venom in the medical field highlight the important role that even dangerous creatures like the Gila monster can play in advancing human health.

In conclusion, the Gila monster is a fascinating and unique species of lizard that combines venomous defense mechanisms, a specialized diet, and remarkable survival strategies. It plays an important ecological role in its desert habitat, controlling populations of smaller animals and helping to maintain balance in the ecosystem. Although it faces threats from human activity and environmental changes, conservation efforts are helping to ensure that this remarkable creature continues to survive in the wild. Through further research and education, the Gila monster will likely remain a subject of both scientific study and cultural interest for years to come."
Glass Frog,2.2-7.7,Up to 0.03,"Green, Transparent",10-14 days,Insectivore,Rainforests,"Birds, Snakes",0.8,Central and South America,Least Concern,Centrolenidae,20-Oct,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 30,"The Glass Frog is a common name used for several species of frogs in the family Centrolenidae, which are known for their unique and striking appearance. These frogs are typically found in the rainforests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to western Panama and down to Ecuador, Venezuela, and the Amazon Basin. The name ""glass frog"" comes from their translucent skin, which is most prominent on their undersides, allowing observers to see their internal organs, including their heart and digestive system. This characteristic has made them a subject of fascination for both scientists and wildlife enthusiasts alike.

Glass frogs are relatively small, with most species ranging in size from 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1 to 3 inches) in length. They have smooth, lime-green skin on their backs, which helps them blend into the leaves and vegetation of the rainforest canopy where they typically live. Their most remarkable feature is the transparent skin on their underside, which gives them the appearance of a ""glass"" frog when viewed from beneath. The transparency of their skin is due to a lack of pigment in the tissues, and it helps them remain camouflaged from predators such as birds, snakes, and larger amphibians. Their coloration on the back and legs provides additional camouflage amidst the lush greenery of their habitat.

The transparency of the glass frog's skin serves as an effective defense mechanism, as it allows the frog to remain hidden from predators. However, this feature is also a double-edged sword, as it means the frog is highly vulnerable to environmental changes. The frogs are sensitive to pollution and habitat destruction, particularly the destruction of rainforests, which threatens their survival. Loss of habitat due to deforestation and climate change poses significant risks to their populations, as they rely on humid, stable environments to thrive.

Glass frogs are arboreal and spend most of their lives in the treetops or on low vegetation near streams and rivers. They are nocturnal creatures, typically coming out at night to hunt and mate. During the day, they remain hidden in the foliage, where their green color provides excellent camouflage. Glass frogs are insectivores, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including ants, mites, and other tiny insects that they catch with their long, sticky tongues. They have excellent vision and can spot their prey from a distance, using their quick reflexes to snatch insects from the air or from plant surfaces.

Reproduction in glass frogs is fascinating and is linked closely to their aquatic habitat. During the breeding season, males call to attract females with a soft, high-pitched sound that resonates through the dense forest. Once a female selects a male, the pair mates on the underside of leaves near streams or rivers. After mating, the female lays her eggs on the underside of a leaf above a water source, and the male fertilizes them externally. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which then fall into the water below, where they undergo the typical amphibian life cycle, transforming into juvenile frogs. This method of egg-laying protects the developing eggs from being washed away or eaten by predators, as they are well camouflaged on the leaves.

One of the unique behaviors of glass frogs during reproduction is their involvement in guarding the eggs. In some species, males take responsibility for guarding the eggs until they hatch, keeping a close watch on them to protect them from potential threats such as ants or other predators. This parental care ensures the survival of the next generation of frogs, and in some species, males will even use their bodies to shield the eggs from direct sunlight, helping to regulate temperature and humidity levels for optimal development."
Goblin Shark,Up to 320,Up to 210,Pinkish-gray,30-35,Carnivore,Deep-sea,"Larger Fish, Other Sharks",1.6-3,Worldwide,Data Deficient,Mitsukurinidae,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"The Goblin Shark (Mitsukurina owstoni) is a unique and rare species of deep-sea shark known for its eerie, alien-like appearance. Often referred to as a ""living fossil,"" it is the sole extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae and has remained relatively unchanged for over 100 million years, offering scientists a glimpse into the evolutionary history of sharks. Goblin sharks are found primarily in deep waters around the world, typically at depths of 100 to 1,200 meters (328 to 3,937 feet), making them elusive and rarely encountered by humans. They inhabit various regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with reports of sightings off the coasts of Japan, South Africa, and the Gulf of Mexico.

One of the most striking features of the goblin shark is its long, flattened snout, which extends well beyond its mouth, giving the shark a distinctive ""goblin-like"" appearance. The shark's most unusual and fascinating characteristic is its highly extendable jaw. The jaw can protrude outward, similar to a spring-loaded mechanism, allowing the goblin shark to snatch up prey with remarkable speed. This feeding strategy is effective in the deep-sea environment, where the prey is often scarce and hard to catch. The goblin shark's teeth are long, sharp, and needle-like, ideal for grasping soft-bodied prey such as fish, squid, and crustaceans. Its mouth is equipped with specialized teeth that are perfect for holding slippery prey, allowing it to swallow them whole.

Goblin sharks are generally slow-moving creatures, and much of their behavior and biology remain a mystery due to their deep-sea habitat. They are thought to be solitary hunters, using their electroreception abilities to detect the faint electrical signals emitted by potential prey in the dark, oxygen-depleted waters. Despite their fearsome appearance, goblin sharks are not considered a threat to humans, as they primarily live in deep waters far from populated areas. Goblin sharks are not known to engage with humans and pose no danger, as they are rarely encountered.

The goblin shark’s diet primarily consists of bottom-dwelling fish, squid, and crustaceans, which it captures with its extendable jaw. This method of feeding is an adaptation to its deep-sea environment, where visibility is low and prey is often sparse. The goblin shark’s unique jaw structure and feeding behavior allow it to efficiently hunt in these challenging conditions. Their slow metabolism also means they are not highly active predators, but instead rely on patience and precision when hunting.

Conservation-wise, the goblin shark is not currently considered to be under significant threat, largely because of its deep-sea habitat and low human interaction. However, deep-sea ecosystems face growing threats from activities like commercial fishing, deep-sea mining, and climate change, which could impact the goblin shark's environment. As a result, research into the species and its habitat is crucial to understanding how these sharks might be affected by human activities in the future.

In conclusion, the goblin shark is a fascinating, enigmatic species that has evolved to thrive in one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Its unique features, such as its elongated snout and extendable jaw, make it a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. While the goblin shark is not dangerous to humans and is not currently at risk, the need for continued study and protection of deep-sea habitats remains critical for the conservation of this and other mysterious species that inhabit the ocean’s depths."
Golden Lion Tamarin,Up to 35,Up to 0.7,"Golden, Reddish-brown",15,Omnivore,Tropical Rainforests,"Birds, Snakes",13-Aug,"Brazil, Southeastern Bahia",Endangered,Callitrichidae,125-130,13-Aug,Social groups,03-Jan,"The Golden Lion Tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) is a small, striking primate native to the coastal rainforests of southeastern Brazil, particularly in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Known for its vibrant, golden-orange fur and lion-like mane, this species is one of the most visually distinctive members of the tamarin family. Golden lion tamarins are arboreal, spending much of their time in the upper canopy of the rainforest, where they forage, play, and build their nests in the trees. They are small in size, with adults typically weighing around 500 grams (about 1 pound) and measuring approximately 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 inches) in body length, with tails that can be even longer.

These tamarins are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a varied diet that includes insects, spiders, small fruits, nectar, and occasionally small vertebrates like lizards or birds. They are particularly skilled at foraging in the trees, using their long fingers and claws to help them extract insects from bark or small crevices. The golden lion tamarin is an important part of the rainforest ecosystem, as its feeding habits help control insect populations and contribute to seed dispersal, aiding the regeneration of the forest. Despite their small size, they are highly social animals that live in family groups, typically consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring, but sometimes extending to include older siblings or other relatives.

Golden lion tamarins are known for their social and cooperative behavior. Within their family groups, individuals work together to care for the young, with non-breeding individuals helping to look after the infants. The family’s main tasks include defending their territory, foraging for food, and grooming one another. Grooming is a key social activity that strengthens the bonds between members of the group. These tamarins communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, including whistles, trills, and soft calls that help maintain group cohesion and warn of potential threats.

Reproduction in golden lion tamarins is an interesting aspect of their behavior. The females usually give birth to twins, which is relatively common among tamarin species. After birth, the father plays a significant role in caring for the infants, carrying them on his back and helping to protect them. This cooperative parenting is essential to the survival of the young, as the rainforest can be a challenging environment for small primates. The young are weaned at around 3 to 4 months of age and become more independent, though they continue to rely on the group for support and guidance as they grow.

Today, while the golden lion tamarin is no longer classified as critically endangered, it remains vulnerable due to ongoing habitat threats, including deforestation and the fragmentation of the rainforest. The small population of wild golden lion tamarins is confined to a limited area, making them vulnerable to environmental changes and genetic bottlenecks. Continued conservation efforts, including habitat protection, community engagement, and sustainable development practices, are essential for ensuring the long-term survival of the species.

In conclusion, the golden lion tamarin is a remarkable and charismatic primate that has become a symbol of successful wildlife conservation. Its striking appearance, complex social structure, and the conservation challenges it faces highlight the importance of protecting biodiversity and preserving critical ecosystems. With continued efforts, the golden lion tamarin serves as a hopeful example of how targeted conservation actions can lead to the recovery of endangered species and their habitats."
Golden Poison Dart Frog,06-Mar,Up to 2.4,Various,17,Insectivore,Rainforests,Snakes,0.3,Western Colombia,Near Threatened,Dendrobatidae,14,0.3,Solitary,Up to 40,"The Golden Poison Dart Frog (Phyllobates terribilis) is one of the most toxic animals on Earth and is renowned for its vibrant golden-yellow coloration. Native to the rainforests of western Colombia, particularly in the dense, humid environments along the Pacific coast, these frogs are typically found in lowland areas near slow-moving streams and rivers. They inhabit the lush understory of the rainforest, where they can find the invertebrate prey that is essential to their diet. The striking coloration of the golden poison dart frog serves as a warning to potential predators, signaling that it is highly toxic and dangerous to consume. This vibrant hue, characteristic of other poisonous dart frogs, is a form of aposematic coloration, which is a survival adaptation meant to deter predation.

The toxicity of the golden poison dart frog comes from alkaloid compounds, particularly batrachotoxin, found in its skin. This toxin is incredibly potent and can be deadly in even small doses. In fact, it is considered one of the most toxic substances known in nature. The frogs’ toxicity is linked to their diet, as they obtain these toxins from eating certain small arthropods, such as ants, mites, and beetles, which are found in their native environment. The alkaloids are absorbed by the frogs and stored in their skin, making them highly poisonous to would-be predators, such as birds, snakes, and other reptiles. The toxicity is so high that just a single gram of the frog's skin could potentially kill several humans. However, interestingly, frogs raised in captivity and fed a diet devoid of these toxic insects do not develop the same level of toxicity, suggesting that the frogs’ poison is diet-dependent.

Despite their extreme toxicity, golden poison dart frogs are relatively small, measuring only about 4 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2 inches) in length. They are also known for their impressive agility, leaping from plant to plant in search of food or to evade threats. Their primary diet consists of ants, termites, and other small invertebrates, which are rich in the alkaloids that contribute to their venomous skin. These frogs are most active during the day, foraging on the rainforest floor and low vegetation. Their movement is often quick and erratic, helping them avoid predators and capture fast-moving prey.

The reproductive behavior of the golden poison dart frog is fascinating. These frogs are typically solitary or live in small groups, with males calling to attract females. The male produces a soft, trilling sound that is often heard during the rainy season, a time when these frogs are most active. Once a female is attracted, she lays her eggs on moist leaves or debris near a water source. After the eggs hatch into tadpoles, the male transports the tadpoles one by one to a water-filled crevice, where they continue their development. The female may return to care for the tadpoles by depositing unfertilized eggs for them to eat, ensuring the tadpoles have adequate nutrition during their metamorphosis. This parental care is a crucial part of the frogs' reproductive success and helps to protect the young from predators.

In conclusion, the golden poison dart frog is a fascinating example of the power of chemical defenses in the animal kingdom. Its vibrant coloration, potent toxins, and complex reproductive behaviors make it one of the most interesting species in the amphibian world. However, its survival is increasingly threatened by environmental destruction, and ongoing efforts are necessary to protect both the frogs and their fragile rainforest habitats. Through conservation initiatives and awareness, there is hope that these incredible creatures can continue to thrive in their native environment."
Great White Shark,Up to 610,Up to 2268,Grey,30-40,Carnivore,Oceans,Orcas,56,Oceans worldwide,Vulnerable,Lamnidae,12-18 months,56,Solitary,2-14 (approx.),"The Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is one of the most well-known and formidable predators in the ocean. It is a large, powerful shark found in coastal waters around the world, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. Great whites are often associated with open ocean habitats but also thrive along coastlines, where they hunt seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. Known for their impressive size, these sharks can grow to lengths of up to 6 meters (20 feet) and weigh as much as 1,100 kilograms (2,400 pounds), although most individuals tend to be smaller. They have a distinctive appearance, with a robust body, a conical snout, and sharp triangular teeth, all of which are adapted for their predatory lifestyle.

Great white sharks are apex predators, sitting at the top of the food chain in marine ecosystems. Their diet primarily consists of large marine mammals like seals and sea lions, but they also feed on fish, turtles, and occasionally smaller sharks. The great white’s hunting strategy is based on ambush tactics, often attacking from below with great speed and power, launching themselves toward their prey in a sudden burst of acceleration. This hunting technique is especially effective when the shark uses the element of surprise, striking swiftly and efficiently. They are capable of swimming at high speeds, reaching up to 56 km/h (35 mph), enabling them to chase down and overpower fast-moving prey.

Great white sharks have highly specialized senses that make them incredibly effective hunters. They possess an acute sense of smell and can detect a single drop of blood in the water from miles away. Additionally, they have an extraordinary ability to sense the electrical fields emitted by potential prey through specialized organs called the Ampullae of Lorenzini. These organs, located around the shark's snout, help the great white detect the small electrical signals produced by the muscles and nervous systems of prey, especially useful for locating animals buried in the sand or swimming in murky waters. Their keen eyesight and powerful jaws complete their predatory toolkit, allowing them to locate and capture a wide variety of prey.

Reproduction in great white sharks is relatively slow compared to other fish species. They are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch inside the female’s body, and the young are born alive. Females give birth to live pups after a lengthy gestation period of about 11 months. Typically, a female will give birth to between 2 and 14 pups, which are fully independent and capable of hunting on their own shortly after birth. Great white sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are around 12 years old, and they can live up to 70 years or more, making them slow to reproduce and vulnerable to overfishing.

Great white shark populations have been impacted by human activities, particularly commercial fishing and trophy hunting. Overfishing has reduced their numbers in many areas, and the sharks are often accidentally caught in fishing nets or on longlines. As a result, great white sharks are listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these apex predators, including measures to reduce bycatch, create marine protected areas, and increase awareness of their ecological importance.

In conclusion, the great white shark is one of the most iconic and powerful animals in the ocean, perfectly adapted to its role as a top predator. Its size, speed, and specialized senses make it an exceptional hunter, while its slow reproductive rate and vulnerability to human activities highlight the need for continued conservation efforts. Despite their fearsome reputation, great whites play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, and protecting them is essential for the balance of ocean life."
Green Anaconda,Up to 550,Up to 97.5,Olive-green,15,Carnivore,"Swamps, Marshes","Jaguars, Caymans",16-24 (in water),South America,Least Concern,Boidae,150-160,24,Solitary,Up to 80,"The Green Anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is one of the largest and most powerful snakes in the world. Native to the tropical rainforests, wetlands, and rivers of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, the green anaconda thrives in aquatic environments, where it is well adapted to life both in the water and on land. It can grow to impressive sizes, with adult females, which are typically larger than males, reaching lengths of up to 9 meters (30 feet) or more, though they are usually around 5 to 6 meters (16 to 20 feet) long. Their weight can exceed 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), making them the heaviest known snake species in the world.

Green anacondas are non-venomous constrictors, meaning they kill their prey by wrapping around it and squeezing tightly until the animal suffocates. These snakes are ambush predators, often waiting for unsuspecting prey to come near the water’s edge before striking. They primarily hunt large animals, including fish, birds, wild pigs, capybaras, and even caimans. Their powerful muscles allow them to constrict their prey with immense force, overpowering animals that are much larger than themselves. Once the prey is subdued, the anaconda swallows it whole, using its highly flexible jaw to expand and accommodate the size of the meal. It may take days for the snake to fully digest its food, depending on the size of the prey.

One of the green anaconda's most notable adaptations is its semi-aquatic lifestyle. These snakes are strong swimmers and spend a considerable amount of time submerged in water. They use their muscular bodies to propel themselves through rivers and swamps, where they hunt and move with great ease. The green anaconda's coloration, a mix of dark green and yellowish patterns, provides excellent camouflage in the murky waters of the Amazon and Orinoco basins, helping them remain undetected by both prey and potential predators. While they are capable of moving on land, green anacondas are slower and more vulnerable when out of water.

Reproduction in green anacondas is relatively slow. They are ovoviviparous, meaning that the females give birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. After mating, which occurs during the dry season, females can give birth to a large number of offspring, sometimes up to 40 babies at a time, though the number varies. The young are born in the water and are immediately capable of swimming and hunting small prey, though they rely on the protection of their mother's territory during the early stages of life. Despite their impressive size, green anacondas have few natural predators, though large cats like jaguars or caimans may occasionally pose a threat to young anacondas.

The green anaconda is not currently considered to be endangered, though habitat destruction, particularly deforestation, poses a threat to their populations. The draining of wetlands for agriculture and development can reduce the availability of suitable habitats for these snakes, and they are sometimes hunted for their skins or captured for the exotic pet trade. However, due to their remote habitats and large, powerful nature, they are not as vulnerable as other snake species. Conservation efforts focus on preserving their natural habitats and raising awareness about their role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystems they inhabit.

Green Sea Turtle,Up to 120,Up to 200,Greenish-brown,80-100,Herbivore,"Oceans, Coastal Areas",Predatory Fish,1.6-3.2,Oceans worldwide,Endangered,Cheloniidae,45-70,35,Solitary,Varies,"The Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas) is one of the most well-known and widely distributed species of sea turtles. It is found in warm tropical and subtropical oceans around the world, including the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. Despite being called the ""green"" sea turtle, its name actually comes from the color of its fat, which is green due to its herbivorous diet. These turtles are large, with adult females typically weighing between 150 to 300 kilograms (330 to 660 pounds) and measuring up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length. They are known for their long, graceful migrations and are an iconic species in marine conservation.

Green sea turtles are primarily herbivores, feeding on seagrasses and algae, which they graze from the ocean floor. This diet is crucial for the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs, as their grazing helps prevent these plants from becoming overgrown and promotes biodiversity. The turtles' strong jaws are adapted for cutting and tearing seagrass, and they spend a significant amount of time in shallow coastal areas, where seagrass meadows are abundant. In contrast, the younger, smaller turtles are more opportunistic feeders and may also eat invertebrates such as jellyfish and crabs. This shift in diet as they mature plays a key role in their survival and growth.

Green sea turtles are well-adapted to their aquatic lifestyle. They have streamlined, flat shells, which allow them to swim efficiently through the water, and powerful flippers that enable them to cover long distances. These turtles are migratory, often traveling thousands of kilometers between their feeding grounds and nesting beaches. Females return to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs, a behavior known as natal homing. They come ashore, typically at night, to dig nests in the sand, where they lay hundreds of eggs. After laying their eggs, the females return to the ocean, leaving the eggs to incubate in the warm sand. The hatchlings emerge after around 60 days, but only a small fraction survive the perilous journey to the sea, where they face numerous predators, including birds, crabs, and fish.

The reproductive cycle of the green sea turtle is fascinating and involves long-term care by the mother. After hatching, the young turtles make their way to the sea, guided by the moonlight reflecting off the water. They then begin their ""lost years,"" a phase of their life when they remain in the open ocean, drifting for several years before returning to coastal waters as juveniles. Once they mature, usually at around 20 to 50 years of age, they return to coastal areas to start the cycle again, mating and nesting. Despite the many challenges they face in their early years, including predation and the hazards of ocean currents, green sea turtles can live to be 80 years old or more, making them long-lived species.

Green sea turtles, like many marine species, face numerous threats to their survival. Habitat destruction, particularly the loss of nesting beaches due to coastal development, poses a significant challenge. Rising sea levels caused by climate change also threaten their nesting sites. Additionally, green sea turtles are often affected by human activities, such as entanglement in fishing gear, poaching for their meat and shells, and accidental consumption of plastic debris, which can cause blockages in their digestive system. Climate change also affects the sex ratio of turtle populations, as the temperature of the sand where the eggs incubate determines the sex of the hatchlings. Warmer temperatures tend to produce more females, which could lead to an imbalance in the population.

Conservation efforts for the green sea turtle have been extensive and include protecting nesting sites, reducing bycatch through improved fishing gear and practices, and international cooperation to safeguard migratory routes. Many countries have established marine protected areas and nesting sanctuaries to help ensure the survival of green sea turtles. In some regions, conservation groups work with local communities to monitor nesting activities and protect the eggs and hatchlings from predators."
Grevy's Zebra,130-160,350-450,"White, Black",20-30,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Lions, Hyenas",64,Eastern Africa,Endangered,Equidae,390-396,64,Herd-based,1,"Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest and most distinctive species of zebra, native to the semi-arid grasslands and savannas of northeastern Kenya and parts of Ethiopia. Known for their striking appearance, Grevy's zebras are characterized by narrow, closely spaced black and white stripes that cover their bodies from head to tail. Unlike other zebra species, Grevy's zebras have a white underbelly, and their stripes are thinner and more numerous, extending across their entire bodies, including their legs and face. Their large ears and relatively long, slender bodies give them a unique profile among zebras. They stand out from other zebras not only in appearance but also in their behavior and ecology.

Grevy's zebras are herbivores and graze on a variety of grasses, though they tend to favor tough, drought-resistant grasses and shrubs, which are common in the arid environments they inhabit. Unlike the more social plains zebra, Grevy’s zebras are more solitary or form small, loose groups, usually consisting of a mother and her offspring or bachelor groups of males. Adult males are highly territorial, often marking their territory with dung piles, which they use to communicate with other zebras. Their diets depend heavily on the availability of water, which can be scarce in their habitat, so they are known to travel long distances in search of food and water sources.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Grevy’s zebra is its reproductive behavior. Unlike other zebra species, which typically have a harem structure where one male mates with several females, Grevy's zebra males are usually solitary and do not form permanent harems. Instead, they engage in competitive mating behaviors, with dominant males attracting females through displays of strength, including aggressive behavior and vocalizations. After mating, females give birth to a single foal, which is highly dependent on the mother for care during its early months. Foals are born with brownish, rather than black, stripes, which gradually darken and become more defined as they mature.

Grevy's zebras are a vulnerable species due to the threats they face from habitat loss, hunting, and competition with livestock for resources. The conversion of their natural habitat into agricultural land and the expansion of human settlements has reduced their available range, particularly in Kenya, where most of the population resides. Additionally, the increasing presence of livestock can lead to competition for grazing and water resources, which strains the survival of Grevy's zebras. Poaching for their hides, though less common now, also remains a concern. As a result, Grevy's zebra is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Conservation efforts are underway to protect Grevy's zebras and their habitats. In Kenya, wildlife management programs and protected areas aim to reduce the impact of human encroachment and maintain viable populations of these zebras. The Grevy’s Zebra Trust, a non-governmental organization, has been instrumental in monitoring zebra populations, educating local communities, and promoting conservation measures to ensure the species’ long-term survival. Efforts also include creating wildlife corridors that connect isolated populations and working with local herders to minimize conflicts between livestock and zebras."
Hagfish,Up to 127,Up to 0.7,"Pink, Gray",Up to 300,Scavenger,"Ocean Floor, Deep-sea",Various Predators,0.8,Oceans worldwide,Least Concern,Myxinidae,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"The hagfish (Myxine spp.) is one of the most primitive and unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, often regarded as a ""living fossil"" due to its ancient lineage, which dates back over 300 million years. It is a jawless fish that inhabits the deep ocean, particularly around the coasts of cold, temperate, and polar waters. Hagfish are eel-like in appearance, with long, slender bodies and a smooth, slimy texture. They are typically small, ranging from about 30 to 80 cm (12 to 31 inches) in length, although some species can grow larger. These fish are known for their distinct lack of traditional vertebrate features, such as jaws and bones, which makes them a unique branch in the evolutionary tree.

One of the most remarkable features of the hagfish is its ability to produce large quantities of slime. When threatened, hagfish secrete a thick, mucous substance from specialized glands located along their bodies. This slime expands rapidly in water, creating a slippery, gelatinous coating that can entangle predators, making it difficult for them to maintain a grip. The slime can also clog the gills of predatory fish, potentially suffocating them. This defense mechanism helps protect hagfish from many potential predators, such as larger fish and marine mammals.

Hagfish are scavengers and feed primarily on dead or decaying organic matter. They are often found feeding on the remains of fish, marine mammals, and other animals that have sunk to the ocean floor. Using their sharp, tooth-like structures, called ""keratinous teeth,"" which are located on a tongue-like protrusion, hagfish tear apart flesh to consume it. Despite their lack of jaws, hagfish are well-adapted to this scavenging lifestyle. They are equipped with a keen sense of smell, which allows them to detect carrion from great distances. Their ability to enter the body of dead animals through small openings, like the eyes or mouth, further demonstrates their remarkable scavenger abilities.

Hagfish are also unique in their circulatory system and their lack of true vertebrae. Instead of a vertebral column (backbone), they have a notochord, which is a flexible rod of cartilage that supports their body structure. This primitive feature places them among the earliest forms of vertebrate animals. Additionally, hagfish have a simple heart and multiple pairs of gills, which they use to extract oxygen from the water. They are able to survive in low-oxygen environments due to their specialized adaptations, which include the ability to tolerate low levels of oxygen in their surroundings for extended periods.

Reproduction in hagfish remains largely mysterious, as very little is known about their breeding habits. They are believed to have external fertilization, with females releasing eggs into the water, where they are fertilized by the male. Hagfish are slow-growing creatures, and their lifespan is estimated to be around 5 to 10 years, though their reproductive rate is not well understood. The slow reproduction rate combined with their reliance on the deep-sea ecosystem makes them particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, such as overfishing or habitat destruction.

Hagfish are not typically a target for commercial fishing, but their slime has been of interest to the textile industry due to its unique properties. The slime is extremely strong and elastic, and there have been efforts to harvest it for use in making textiles. However, such activities have raised concerns about the impact on hagfish populations, especially since they reproduce slowly and live in relatively stable but vulnerable deep-sea habitats."
Harp Seal,Up to 180,Up to 160,"Silver, Gray",20-35,Carnivore,"Arctic, Atlantic Ocean","Polar Bears, Orcas",19-22,"Arctic, Atlantic Ocean",Least Concern,Phocidae,335,28,Group-based,1,"The Harp Seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) is a species of seal that is found primarily in the cold, icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. Recognized for its distinctive black markings on the face and its graceful swimming abilities, the harp seal is a medium-sized pinniped, typically measuring around 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 6.5 feet) in length and weighing between 100 to 140 kilograms (220 to 310 pounds) as adults. The species gets its name from the harp-shaped black markings on the back of its body, which are most prominent in adult males, while the rest of the body is usually a silvery-gray or white color. Harp seals are well adapted to their cold environment, with thick layers of fat and fur that help insulate them in icy waters.

Harp seals are highly migratory, often traveling long distances in search of food and breeding sites. During the winter, they congregate in large numbers on sea ice to give birth and nurse their young. The breeding season usually takes place between late winter and early spring, where female harp seals give birth to a single pup on the ice. These pups are born with a soft, white fur called lanugo, which helps keep them warm in the freezing temperatures. The mothers nurse their pups for about 12 to 18 days, during which time the pups gain weight rapidly, sometimes more than doubling their birth weight. After weaning, the pups begin learning to swim and hunt for food.

Harp seals are carnivorous and have a diet that consists mainly of fish, squid, and other marine invertebrates. They are skilled hunters and use their excellent swimming abilities to dive to depths of up to 200 meters (656 feet) in search of food. Harp seals are equipped with sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) that help them detect prey in the dark, murky waters of the ocean. They rely on their strong front flippers for propulsion while swimming, and their streamlined bodies allow them to move efficiently through the water.

Despite their large populations, harp seals face threats from climate change and human activities. The loss of sea ice due to warming temperatures is a significant concern for the species, as they rely on the ice for breeding and pupping. Without stable ice platforms, harp seals may be forced to move to less suitable areas, which could affect their ability to reproduce successfully. Additionally, harp seals have been historically targeted by commercial hunting, particularly for their fur, which has contributed to population declines in certain regions. While hunting of harp seals has been banned or regulated in many places, illegal hunting and the hunting of seals for their pelts continues in some parts of the world.

Conservation efforts for harp seals focus on protecting their habitats, especially the sea ice on which they breed. International agreements, such as the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, play a role in reducing hunting pressures. Efforts to mitigate climate change by addressing greenhouse gas emissions are also critical to ensuring the long-term survival of harp seals and their ecosystem."
Harpy Eagle,86-107,4.5-9,"Black, White",25-35,Carnivore,Rainforests,"Jaguars, Snakes",50,Central and South America,Near Threatened,Accipitridae,56-58,50,Solitary,1,"The Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) is one of the largest and most powerful eagles in the world, known for its striking appearance and formidable hunting abilities. Native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, the harpy eagle is found in regions from southern Mexico through Central America to as far south as Argentina and Brazil. It is a top predator in its habitat, typically inhabiting lowland and montane rainforests, where it preys on medium-sized mammals and birds. The harpy eagle has a distinctive appearance, with a powerful build, large talons, and a prominent crest of feathers on its head, which gives it a majestic, almost mythical look. Adults can reach up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length and have a wingspan of about 2 meters (6.5 feet). They are also known for their massive, curved talons, which can grow up to 13 centimeters (5 inches) long—larger than those of a grizzly bear.

The harpy eagle is a skilled and powerful predator, primarily hunting in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its diet consists mostly of medium-sized mammals, such as monkeys and sloths, and large birds, including toucans and parrots. The eagle hunts by flying silently through the forest and using its keen eyesight to spot prey from above. Once it identifies a target, the harpy eagle swoops down with tremendous speed and strength, using its large talons to capture its prey, which it then carries back to a perch to consume. Due to its large size and powerful build, the harpy eagle is capable of taking down prey that many other birds of prey would be unable to handle, and it is often referred to as one of the most powerful birds in the world.

The harpy eagle’s preferred habitat—dense tropical forests—is increasingly threatened by deforestation, which is one of the primary dangers to their survival. As forests are cleared for agriculture, logging, and urban development, harpy eagles lose their habitat, and the prey they depend on also becomes scarce. Additionally, because they are top predators, harpy eagles are vulnerable to indirect effects of habitat loss, such as disturbances in the food chain. Climate change, which affects rainfall patterns and forest health, further exacerbates these threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the harpy eagle as Near Threatened, with its population declining in parts of its range. Conservation efforts are focused on preserving its forest habitats, protecting nesting sites, and reducing human-wildlife conflict.

To protect the harpy eagle, several conservation initiatives have been established. In some areas, forest conservation programs have focused on maintaining large tracts of rainforest to ensure that harpy eagles have enough space to live and hunt. Nesting sites, which are typically located in tall trees, are also monitored to prevent disturbance from logging or human encroachment. In some regions, efforts have been made to involve local communities in conservation work, raising awareness about the importance of preserving these eagles and their habitats. Additionally, protected areas and national parks in countries like Panama, Colombia, and Brazil offer a safe haven for harpy eagles, where they can thrive away from the threats posed by human activity."
Hippopotamus,120-160,1300-3200,Grey,40-50,Herbivore,"Rivers, Lakes","Lions, Crocodiles",25,Sub-Saharan Africa,Vulnerable,Hippopotamidae,230-250,30,Group-based,1,"The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of the heaviest land animals, second only to the elephant. Adult hippos typically weigh between 1,500 and 4,000 kilograms (3,300 to 8,800 pounds), with males being larger than females. They have a distinctive appearance, with massive, barrel-shaped bodies, short legs, and large mouths. Their skin is thick and mostly hairless, and it secretes a reddish substance that acts as both a sunscreen and an antibacterial agent, giving the animal a reddish tint. Hippos are known for their unique behavior and dual life in water and on land, which is a key feature of their biology and ecology.

Despite their bulky size and somewhat slow-moving appearance, hippos are highly adapted to life in and around water. They spend most of their days submerged in rivers, lakes, or swamps to keep cool, as their thick skin does not sweat and can easily overheat in the sun. While they can remain underwater for up to five minutes, they must resurface to breathe. Hippos are capable swimmers and use their webbed feet to propel themselves through the water. They are also excellent at walking along the bottom of rivers, where they forage for aquatic plants. On land, hippos typically come out at dusk or during the night to graze on grass, their primary food source. They can travel several kilometers to find suitable grazing areas and can consume large quantities of grass in a single night, sometimes up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of vegetation.

Hippos are social animals and live in groups, known as pods, schools, or bloats. These groups typically consist of around 10 to 30 individuals, although larger aggregations can form. The groups are usually led by a dominant male, who defends the territory and ensures the safety of the females and young. Hippos are known to be territorial, particularly in the water, where they engage in vocalizations such as grunts, wheezes, and bellows to communicate with each other and establish dominance. Despite their relatively peaceful appearance, hippos can be very aggressive, especially when defending their territory or young. They are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other large animal, mainly due to their aggression toward boats or humans who inadvertently get too close.

The reproductive behavior of hippos is fascinating. They typically mate in the water, where both males and females come together for a short time to mate. Female hippos give birth to a single calf after an 8-month gestation period. Calves are usually born underwater, where they can immediately swim and surface to take their first breath. They are nursed by their mother and remain close to her for the first few months of life. Calves are very vulnerable to predators, and while adult hippos are difficult for most predators to threaten, young hippos are often preyed upon by lions, crocodiles, and hyenas.

Despite their size and strength, hippos face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal hunting. As human populations expand, the natural habitats of hippos—such as rivers and lakes—are being encroached upon. Hippos are also threatened by poaching for their meat and ivory-like teeth, which are highly valued in some cultures. The destruction of wetlands and river ecosystems further exacerbates their declining numbers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the hippopotamus as Vulnerable, with populations estimated to be between 115,000 and 130,000 individuals. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and creating safe corridors between protected areas to ensure that hippos can roam freely without encountering threats."
Horseshoe Crab,Up to 56,Up to 2.3,Brownish-gray,Up to 20 years,"Carnivore, Scavenger","Ocean Floor, Coastal Areas","Birds, Predatory Fish",0.8-1.6,"Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico",Vulnerable,Limulidae,2 weeks,Not Applicable,Solitary,Thousands,"The horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) is a marine arthropod that is often mistaken for a true crab due to its similar appearance, though it is not closely related to crabs at all. Horseshoe crabs are part of the class Merostomata, and they are more closely related to arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, than to true crabs. These ancient creatures have been around for more than 450 million years, making them one of the oldest living species on Earth, often referred to as ""living fossils."" Horseshoe crabs have a distinctive, horseshoe-shaped exoskeleton that protects their soft body and gives them their name. Their body is divided into three main parts: the prosoma (head), mesosoma (body), and the tail spine, or telson. They typically grow to about 40-50 cm (15-20 inches) in length and are usually found in coastal habitats along the eastern shores of North America, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf of Mexico.

Despite their name and appearance, horseshoe crabs are not crabs, but rather arthropods with a hard outer shell made of chitin, providing them with strong protection against predators. They are primarily bottom dwellers, living in shallow waters along the coast, where they feed on a diet consisting of small invertebrates, such as worms, mollusks, and detritus. They use their five pairs of legs to scavenge for food on the sea floor. Their mouth, located on the underside of their body, is used to consume food, while specialized legs near the mouth help them manipulate and ingest their prey. Horseshoe crabs also have compound eyes, providing them with a broad field of vision. Some species, like the Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), possess a remarkable feature in their eyes—multiple types of eyes that detect both visible and ultraviolet light, helping them navigate the sandy, murky seafloor.

One of the most notable features of horseshoe crabs is their role in medicine. Their blue blood, which contains a copper-based molecule called hemocyanin for oxygen transport, is used in a crucial test for bacterial contamination. The blood of horseshoe crabs contains a unique substance known as Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), which reacts to bacterial endotoxins. This reaction has been harnessed in the LAL assay, a method used to test medical equipment, vaccines, and surgical devices for harmful bacteria. This test is extremely sensitive and has been vital in ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical products. Unfortunately, this has led to concerns about the impact on horseshoe crab populations, as they are often harvested for their blood in this process. Although many crabs are released back into the wild after blood collection, the procedure can sometimes result in high mortality rates, especially if the crabs are subjected to repeated blood draws.

Horseshoe crabs have a unique reproductive cycle, which occurs on sandy shores, often during the spring and summer months. During high tides, males gather around females on the beach, and the females lay large clusters of eggs in the sand. These eggs are then fertilized externally by the males. The eggs are an important food source for migratory shorebirds, such as the red knot, which rely on them to fuel their long migrations. Once the eggs hatch, the young horseshoe crabs, known as ""juveniles,"" are released into the water where they will continue to grow through several molts before reaching adulthood. The horseshoe crab's life cycle is slow, and they take several years to reach full maturity.

Although horseshoe crabs are not currently at risk of extinction, their populations are facing threats from habitat destruction, overharvesting for bait in the fishing industry, and the medical blood trade. Over the years, their populations have decreased in some regions due to these pressures, which has had ripple effects on ecosystems that depend on them. The harvesting of horseshoe crabs for bait in the eel and whelk fisheries has particularly impacted their numbers in certain areas. Conservation efforts are being implemented to help protect these ancient creatures, including research into sustainable blood collection methods and habitat protection initiatives."
Hummingbird,7.5-13,20-Feb,Various,5,"Nectar, Insects",Americas,"Birds of Prey, Snakes",40-80,Americas,Least Concern,Trochilidae,13-22,80,Solitary,03-Jan,"The hummingbird is a small, colorful bird belonging to the family Trochilidae, renowned for its remarkable flying abilities and iridescent feathers. Native to the Americas, hummingbirds are most commonly found in Central and South America, although some species also inhabit North America. There are over 300 species of hummingbirds, varying greatly in size, color, and behavior, with the largest species, the giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), reaching up to 23 cm (9 inches) in length, while the smallest, the bee hummingbird (Mellisuga Helena), measures only 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long. Hummingbirds are easily identifiable by their tiny size, rapid wingbeats, and their ability to hover in mid-air as they feed on nectar from flowers.

One of the most distinctive characteristics of hummingbirds is their ability to hover. This feat is made possible by their unique wing structure and rapid wingbeats. Unlike most birds, hummingbirds can rotate their wings in a figure-eight pattern, allowing them to move both forward and backward, as well as hover in place. Their wings beat incredibly fast—up to 80 times per second in some species—which gives them the ability to stay stationary in mid-air while they feed. This hovering behavior is especially useful when they feed on nectar, which is their primary food source. Hummingbirds have long, specialized bills and extendable tongues, which can reach deep into flowers to access nectar. Their tongues can extend up to 1.5 times the length of their bills, allowing them to extract nectar from flowers that other birds cannot reach. In addition to nectar, hummingbirds also consume small insects and spiders for protein, vitamins, and minerals.

Hummingbirds are known for their vivid, iridescent plumage, which can range in color from vibrant greens and blues to reds, purples, and even gold. The brilliant colors of their feathers are not the result of pigments but of microscopic platelets on the feathers that refract light, creating the bright, metallic sheen. These iridescent colors are used in mating displays, where males perform aerial acrobatics to attract females. The plumage of male hummingbirds is often more colorful and flamboyant than that of females, which is typical of many bird species where males compete for the attention of females through visual displays. In addition to their stunning appearance, hummingbirds are known for their high metabolism, which is necessary to support their energetic flight and constant feeding. They have the highest metabolism of any bird species, with their hearts beating up to 1,200 times per minute while hovering.

The life cycle of hummingbirds is relatively short, with most species living between 3 to 5 years, although many fall victim to predators or accidents early in life. Hummingbird nests are small and intricately built, typically constructed using plant down, spider silk, and other soft materials. The female hummingbird builds the nest alone and lays two tiny eggs, which are incubated for about 10-14 days. Once hatched, the chicks are fed a diet of regurgitated nectar and small insects until they are ready to fledge and begin their own independent lives. The nurturing role of the female is crucial, as the mother provides all care to the young after they hatch.

Despite their beauty and uniqueness, hummingbirds face several challenges. Habitat destruction, particularly the loss of native flowering plants, poses a threat to their food sources. Urbanization and the expansion of agricultural lands also lead to the reduction of suitable nesting sites. Additionally, climate change can disrupt the migration patterns of hummingbirds, affecting the availability of food along their migratory routes. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their natural habitats, planting nectar-rich flowers, and providing artificial feeders to support local populations. In some regions, hummingbird sanctuaries and research initiatives are helping to monitor their numbers and ensure their survival."
Humpback Whale,Up to 1700,Up to 30000,"Black, White",45-50,Omnivore,Oceans,Orcas,24-27,Worldwide,Least Concern,Balaenopteridae,365,24-27,Solitary,1,"The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale known for its impressive size, long pectoral fins, and distinctive hump on its back, which is where it gets its name. These whales are found in oceans around the world, with populations migrating between polar feeding grounds and tropical or subtropical breeding areas. Humpback whales can grow to lengths of up to 16 meters (52 feet) and weigh as much as 36,000 kilograms (79,000 pounds). Their large size and long pectoral fins, which can make up one-third of their body length, contribute to their graceful swimming and acrobatic behaviors. Humpback whales are famous for their breaching behavior, where they leap out of the water and splash back down, as well as their intricate songs.

One of the most remarkable features of humpback whales is their songs, which are produced by males during the breeding season. These songs are long, complex, and can last for up to 30 minutes, with different populations having distinct regional ""dialects."" It is still unclear why humpback whales sing, but scientists believe the songs may play a role in mating, with males possibly using them to attract females or communicate with other males. The songs are made up of a series of moans, grunts, and other sounds, which are repeated and varied over time. These songs can travel great distances underwater, allowing whales to communicate across vast expanses of the ocean.

Humpback whales are filter feeders, using their baleen plates—fringed, comb-like structures in their mouths—to filter small organisms, such as krill, plankton, and small fish, from the water. They often feed in areas where there is a high concentration of these organisms, such as upwelling zones in polar waters. To capture their prey, humpbacks use a variety of feeding techniques. One of the most impressive feeding strategies is bubble net feeding, where a group of humpback whales cooperatively creates a ring of bubbles to corral schools of fish into a tight ball, making it easier to swallow large quantities of prey in a single gulp. Humpbacks are known to have a very high energy demand due to their size and migratory nature, so they must consume vast amounts of food during their feeding season to sustain themselves during migration.

Humpback whales are migratory animals, traveling thousands of kilometers between their feeding grounds in colder, nutrient-rich waters near the poles and their breeding grounds in warmer tropical or subtropical waters. This annual migration can cover distances of up to 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) each way. During the migration, humpbacks rely on their energy reserves accumulated in the feeding grounds to sustain them, as they do not feed during their time in warmer waters. The exact route of migration can vary depending on the population, but many humpbacks follow similar paths year after year. The migration is also an important period for reproduction, with females giving birth to calves after a gestation period of about 11 to 12 months.

Reproduction in humpback whales is a long process. Females give birth to a single calf, usually every two to three years. The calf is born in warm, shallow waters and is nursed for several months, relying on its mother's milk to grow and develop. Humpback whale calves are born weighing around 2,000 to 2,500 kilograms (4,400 to 5,500 pounds) and can grow at an astounding rate, gaining about 90 kilograms (200 pounds) per day during the nursing period. After about six months, the calf is weaned and begins to swim and feed on its own. During the first year of life, calves are highly dependent on their mothers for protection and guidance, but they eventually become more independent and capable of migrating on their own."
Iberian Lynx,60-70,14-Sep,Yellowish-brown,13,Carnivore,Mediterranean Scrublands,"Humans, Wildcats",70-80,"Spain, Portugal",Endangered,Felidae,63-67,70-80,Solitary,04-Jan,"The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a critically endangered wild cat species native to the Iberian Peninsula, which includes parts of Spain and Portugal. It is the most endangered of the four species of lynx in the world, and its population has been reduced to alarmingly low numbers due to habitat loss, hunting, and a severe decline in its prey base. The Iberian lynx is known for its striking appearance, characterized by its short, tufted ears, a distinctively short tail with a black tip, and its spotted coat, which is a mixture of golden-brown fur with darker spots. Adult males typically weigh between 12 and 15 kilograms (26 to 33 pounds), while females are slightly smaller. These lynxes are solitary creatures, primarily living in dense forests, scrublands, and grasslands where they can hunt and hide from potential threats.

The Iberian lynx is a skilled predator, mainly hunting small to medium-sized mammals, with rabbits being its primary food source. Historically, the abundance of rabbits in the Iberian Peninsula supported a thriving lynx population, but in recent decades, rabbit numbers have dramatically declined due to diseases such as myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease. This significant loss of prey, combined with habitat destruction, led to the drastic decline in the Iberian lynx population, which reached critically low levels by the early 2000s. At one point, it was estimated that only around 100 individuals remained in the wild, confined to isolated pockets in southern Spain. The species' diet and habitat preferences make it particularly vulnerable to changes in its environment.

The reproductive behavior of the Iberian lynx is an important aspect of its survival and conservation. These lynxes generally breed in the winter months, with females giving birth to litters of one to four cubs after a gestation period of around two months. The cubs are born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mother's care for the first few months of life. They are gradually introduced to solid food as they grow, and by the time they are six months old, they begin to learn to hunt on their own, though they remain dependent on their mother for up to a year. Given the slow reproduction rate of the species and its low population numbers, conservation efforts have focused on increasing reproduction rates and reintroducing captive-bred lynxes into the wild to strengthen the gene pool and ensure the long-term survival of the species.

Conservation efforts for the Iberian lynx have been intense and multi-faceted. A major success has been the Iberian Lynx Conservation Program, which began in the early 2000s and involved breeding and releasing captive lynxes, restoring habitats, and boosting rabbit populations. These efforts have been supported by both local governments and international organizations. Reintroductions of captive-born lynxes have taken place in several areas of southern Spain, where suitable habitats and prey populations are being restored. The program also includes the construction of wildlife corridors to connect fragmented habitats, allowing lynx populations to expand and interbreed more effectively. Additionally, efforts have been made to reduce human-related threats to the lynx, such as vehicle collisions, poaching, and the destruction of their habitat.

As a result of these concerted efforts, the Iberian lynx population has shown signs of recovery. From fewer than 100 individuals in the early 2000s, the population has grown to around 1,000 individuals as of the most recent estimates. The species has been successfully reintroduced to areas where it had disappeared, and it is now expanding its range in parts of southern Spain and Portugal. The Iberian lynx has also benefited from the establishment of protected areas, including national parks and nature reserves, where conservation measures are strictly enforced. The increasing number of successful breeding pairs and growing populations are signs of hope for the future of the species, although the Iberian lynx remains classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
Indri,Up to 70,Up to 6,"Black, White",15-18,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Fossa, Birds of Prey",24-27,Madagascar,Critically Endangered,Indridae,120-140,24-27,Solitary,1,"The indri (Indri indri), also known as the indris or indris lemur, is one of the largest and most distinctive lemurs, native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is a member of the Indriidae family, which includes other lemurs such as the sifakas. Known for its striking appearance, the indri has a stout, robust body with a thick, woolly coat that is typically black or dark brown, with some individuals displaying white markings on their limbs, chest, and head. Its large, expressive eyes and round face give it a unique and captivating appearance. Adult indris can grow up to about 70 cm (28 inches) in body length, with an additional 35 cm (14 inches) of tail length, though they are tailless, a rare trait among lemurs. They weigh between 6 to 10 kilograms (13 to 22 pounds), making them one of the largest species of lemur.

Indris are arboreal creatures, spending most of their lives in the trees of Madagascar's dense rainforests. Their strong, muscular legs and long, flexible limbs allow them to move with remarkable agility between branches, leaping from tree to tree with ease. Unlike many other lemurs, indris are not known for climbing or moving along the forest floor. Their preferred habitat consists of primary and secondary forests, often in the highland regions of eastern Madagascar, where they thrive in the upper canopy. Indris are primarily herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves, fruits, flowers, and seeds, though they are known to favor certain species of plants that are abundant in their forest home. Their diet is low in energy, and as a result, they have a slow metabolism, which is reflected in their leisurely activity patterns.

One of the most notable aspects of the indri is its vocalizations. The indri is famous for its haunting, loud, and complex songs, which can be heard echoing through the forest. These vocalizations are used for communication between individuals, especially during mating season or to mark territory. The indri’s song is often described as a series of loud, melodious calls that can carry over long distances, reaching up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles). These calls serve several functions, including helping indris locate one another, warn of potential predators, or communicate within groups. The song is typically performed at dawn or dusk, when the indris are most active, and is a critical part of their social behavior.

The indri is a social but solitary animal in terms of its family structure. These lemurs are usually found in small family groups, typically consisting of a mated pair and their offspring. Groups are territorial, and their home ranges can overlap with those of neighboring groups. Indris are known to be monogamous, with strong pair bonds between males and females. After a gestation period of about 120 days, the female gives birth to a single offspring, which remains with the parents for up to three years. The young indri is carried by its mother until it is old enough to move independently, at which point it starts to venture out and forage for food. However, indris remain closely bonded with their families, often staying within the same general area for much of their lives.

Conservation efforts aimed at protecting the indri focus on habitat preservation and restoration. The establishment of protected areas and national parks, such as Andasibe-Mantadia National Park, where many indris are found, has been a crucial step in conserving their populations. In addition to habitat protection, there are ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the importance of indri conservation and the threats they face. Local communities are also involved in conservation initiatives, such as eco-tourism and sustainable forest management, to provide economic alternatives to logging and land clearing."
Japanese Giant Hornet,35-55,Up to 6,"Yellow, Black",6,"Carnivore, Insectivore","Forests, Mountains","Birds, Bees",40-58,"Japan, China, Southeast Asia",Not Evaluated,Vespidae,1 week,Not Applicable,Colony-based,Thousands,"The Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is a large species of hornet native to East Asia, particularly Japan, Korea, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is known for its impressive size, potent sting, and aggressive nature. Adult Japanese giant hornets can reach up to 5 cm (2 inches) in length, making them one of the largest hornet species in the world. They have a distinctive appearance, with a robust, orange-yellow thorax and a dark brown to black abdomen, which is often marked with yellow bands. The hornets also have large mandibles, which they use to capture and kill prey, as well as to defend their nests.

The Japanese giant hornet is primarily carnivorous, preying on other insects, including honeybees, which are a significant part of their diet. These hornets are skilled hunters and often attack honeybee colonies. They use their strong mandibles to decapitate worker bees and carry the bodies back to their nests to feed their larvae. This predation can be devastating to local honeybee populations, and in some cases, entire bee colonies may be wiped out by a single hornet attack. The hornet larvae are fed a diet of partially digested insects, while adult hornets consume sugary substances, such as nectar and tree sap.

The nest of the Japanese giant hornet is usually constructed underground or in hollow trees, though they have also been known to build nests in attics or other sheltered locations. Nests can become quite large, with a single colony sometimes containing several thousand hornets during the peak of the summer season. These colonies are headed by a queen, which starts the nest in the spring and produces eggs that develop into workers and new queens. Worker hornets are responsible for gathering food, defending the nest, and caring for the young, while the new queens will leave the nest in the fall to mate and establish new colonies the following year.

One of the most notable features of the Japanese giant hornet is its potent venom, which is delivered through a large stinger located at the end of the abdomen. The venom contains a mix of toxic compounds, including proteins that affect the nervous system and cause intense pain, as well as enzymes that can cause tissue damage. The sting can cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals, and multiple stings can be potentially life-threatening. In Japan, fatalities from hornet stings are rare but do occur, particularly in cases of severe allergic reactions or when individuals are stung multiple times. Japanese giant hornets are also known for their aggressive behavior when defending their nests, and they may chase perceived threats for long distances.

While the Japanese giant hornet is native to East Asia, it has gained attention in other parts of the world due to its accidental introduction to new regions. In 2019, a small population of Japanese giant hornets was discovered in the United States, specifically in Washington state, raising concerns about the potential ecological impact. There are fears that the hornets could harm local bee populations and disrupt ecosystems where they are not native. However, despite the alarm, experts note that the hornet's presence outside of its native range does not necessarily guarantee widespread invasion, and efforts are being made to monitor and contain the population.

The Japanese giant hornet's reputation for aggressiveness is somewhat exaggerated in popular media, but it is true that they can be dangerous, especially when disturbed. While hornets do not typically seek out human interaction, they will aggressively defend their nests if they feel threatened. The venomous sting can cause intense pain, swelling, and, in extreme cases, anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. As a result, caution is advised when in areas where Japanese giant hornets are present, especially during the late summer and fall when the hornets are most active."
Japanese Macaque,50-60,14-Oct,Brown,20-30,Omnivore,"Forests, Mountains","Humans, Leopards",30,"Japan, China, North Korea",Least Concern,Cercopithecidae,173-194,30,Social groups,1,"The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a species of primate native to Japan. It is one of the most well-known and widely distributed monkey species in Japan, found across a variety of habitats, from subtropical forests to the cold, mountainous regions of the country. The Japanese macaque is a medium-sized monkey, with adult males typically weighing between 11 to 14 kilograms (24 to 31 pounds) and adult females weighing slightly less, around 8 to 11 kilograms (18 to 24 pounds). They have thick fur coats, which vary in color from gray to brown, helping them survive in colder climates. In fact, the Japanese macaque is the northernmost-living primate species in the world, making it well-adapted to colder environments.

These monkeys are highly social animals, living in troops that can range in size from a few individuals to over 100, depending on the availability of food and habitat. The structure of these troops is complex, with social hierarchies and strong bonds, especially between mothers and their offspring. Males tend to leave their natal groups when they mature, while females usually remain in their birth groups for life. Within a troop, individuals have a pecking order, with dominant individuals having priority access to food and mating opportunities. These social bonds help ensure cooperation within the group, such as sharing food or helping care for young. Japanese macaques are known for their strong family ties, and infant care is shared by multiple members of the group.

The diet of the Japanese macaque is omnivorous, consisting of a wide range of foods including fruits, seeds, leaves, insects, small animals, and even crops. Their ability to adapt to various food sources is one reason they are so successful in a variety of environments. They are also known for their ""food sharing"" behavior, where individuals may pass food items to others in the group. In winter, when food is scarce, Japanese macaques may forage more aggressively, using their intelligence to find food sources such as roots and bark, or they may visit agricultural areas where they can find crops.

One of the most remarkable behaviors of the Japanese macaque is its ability to adapt to cold temperatures. In the snowy mountains of Japan, especially in places like Jigokudani Monkey Park, these monkeys have become famous for their habit of bathing in hot springs during the winter. The hot springs provide warmth and comfort in the harsh cold, and the sight of macaques soaking in the steaming waters has become a popular tourist attraction. This behavior is believed to be a way for the macaques to regulate their body temperature and relieve stress. The monkeys also use their grooming behaviors to maintain warmth, as grooming helps strengthen social bonds and provides both physical and emotional comfort.

In terms of reproduction, the female Japanese macaques have a relatively long gestation period of about 6 months, giving birth to a single infant, though twins can occasionally occur. The baby macaques are born with a black face and pink skin, and they cling to their mothers for the first few months of life. Over time, they begin to explore their environment and start eating solid food, though they are still reliant on their mothers for milk until about 6 months of age. Mothers are very protective of their young and will often carry them on their bellies or backs. The young stay with their mothers until they are old enough to socialize with other group members and begin the process of learning the behaviors of the troop.

Despite their adaptability and wide distribution, Japanese macaques face threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict. As human populations in Japan grow, macaques are often forced into closer proximity with urban areas, where they sometimes raid crops or scavenge garbage. In some cases, this has led to negative interactions with humans, though Japanese macaques are generally not aggressive toward humans unless provoked. Conservation efforts are focused on ensuring that their natural habitats remain protected and on educating the public about coexistence with these fascinating primates."
Kakapo,Up to 60,Up to 4,Green,60+,Herbivore,"Forests, Islands","Rats, Cats",2.5,New Zealand,Critically Endangered,Strigopidae,21-24,2.4,Solitary,1-4 (usually 1),"The kākāpō (Strigops habroptila), sometimes known as the owl parrot or owl-faced parrot, is a species of large, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the superfamily Strigopoidea. It is endemic to New Zealand.

The kākāpō is considered to be a ""habitat generalist"". Though they are now confined to islands free of predation, they were once able to live in nearly any climate present on the islands of New Zealand. They survived dry, hot summers on the North Island as well as cold winter temperatures in the sub-alpine areas of Fiordland. Kākāpō seem to have preferred broadleaf or mountain beech and Hall's tōtara forest with mild winters and high rainfall, but the species was not exclusively forest-dwelling.

Kākāpō can be up to 64 cm (25 in) long. They have a combination of unique traits among parrots: finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial disc, owl-style forward-facing eyes with surrounding discs of specially-textured feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large blue feet, relatively short wings and a short tail. It is the world's only flightless parrot, the world's heaviest parrot, and also is nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low basal metabolic rate, and does not have male parental care. It is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds, with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years. Adult males weigh around 1.5–3 kilograms (3.3–6.6 lb); the equivalent figure for females is 0.950–1.6 kilograms (2.09–3.53 lb).

The anatomy of the kākāpō typifies the tendency of bird-evolution on oceanic islands. With few predators and abundant food, kākāpō exhibit island syndrome development, having a generally-robust torso physique at the expense of flight abilities, resulting in reduced shoulder- and wing-muscles, along with a diminished keel on the sternum. Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kākāpō was historically important to Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. It appears in Māori mythology. Heavily hunted in the past, it was used by the Māori both for its meat and for its feathers.

The kākāpō is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night. Though the kākāpō cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also ""parachute"" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees. With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kākāpō cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kākāpō is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kākāpō tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called ""browse signs"".

The kākāpō is critically endangered; the total known population of living individuals is 244 (as of 2024). Known individuals are named, tagged and confined to four small New Zealand islands, all of which are clear of predators; however, in 2023, a reintroduction to mainland New Zealand (Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari) was accomplished. Introduced mammalian predators, such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats almost wiped out the kākāpō. All conservation efforts were unsuccessful until the Kākāpō Recovery Programme began in 1995."
Kangaroo Rat,15-Jul,0.035-0.15,"Brown, Gray",5,Herbivore,Deserts,"Snakes, Birds of Prey",16,North America,Least Concern,Heteromyidae,22-24,16,Solitary,05-Feb,"Kangaroos are marsupials from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot""). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.

As with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. All three terms refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies"". The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size. There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region. This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees. A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:
wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg;
tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);
wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smaller of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females;
kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).
Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.

Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.

The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful, despite a common misconception to the contrary.

The kangaroo along with the koala are symbols of Australia. A kangaroo appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force. The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references.

Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land. Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos."
King Cobra,Up to 550,Up to 9,Olive-green,20-30,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Birds, Snakes",20,"Southeast Asia, South Asia",Vulnerable,Elapidae,90-113,20,Solitary,20-40,"The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is a species complex of snakes endemic to Asia. With an average of 3.18 to 4 m (10.4 to 13.1 ft) and a record length of 5.85 m (19.2 ft), it is the world's longest venomous snake and among the heaviest. Under the genus Ophiophagus, it is not phylogenetically a true cobra despite its common name and some resemblance. Spanning from the Indian Subcontinent through Southeastern Asia to Southern China, the king cobra is widely distributed albeit not commonly seen.

Individuals have diversified colouration across its habitats, from black with white strips to unbroken brownish grey, although after taxonomic re-evaluation, it is no longer the sole member of its genus but is now a species complex; these differences in pattern and other aspects may cause the genus to be split into at least four species, spread across its large geographic range .

Like other snakes, a king cobra receives chemical information via its forked tongue, which picks up scent particles and transfers them to a sensory receptor (Jacobson's organ) located in the roof of its mouth. When it detects the scent of prey, it flicks its tongue to gauge the prey's location, with the twin forks of the tongue acting in stereo. It senses earth-borne vibration and detects moving prey almost 100 m (330 ft) away. Following envenomation, it swallows its prey whole. Because of its flexible jaws, it can swallow prey much larger than its head. It is considered diurnal because it hunts during the day, but has also been seen at night, rarely.

It chiefly hunts other snakes, including those of its own kind, although other lizards and rodents are occasional prey items. This is the only ophidian that constructs an above-ground nest for its eggs, which are purposefully and meticulously gathered and protected by the female throughout the incubation period. Typical threat display of this elapid includes neck-flap spreading, head raising, hissing and sometimes charging. Capable of striking at a considerable range and height with an immense venom yield, envenomation from this species may induce rapid onset of neurotoxic and cytotoxic symptoms, requiring prompt antivenom administration. 

The king cobra is not considered aggressive. It usually avoids humans and slinks off when disturbed, but is known to aggressively defend incubating eggs and attack intruders rapidly. When alarmed, it raises the front part of its body, extends the hood, shows the fangs and hisses loudly. Wild king cobras encountered in Singapore appeared to be placid, but reared up and struck in self defense when cornered. 

The king cobra can be easily irritated by closely approaching objects or sudden movements. When raising its body, the king cobra can still move forward to strike with a long distance, and people may misjudge the safe zone. It can deliver multiple bites in a single attack.

Threatened by habitat destruction, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010. Regarded as the national reptile of India, it has an eminent position in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar."
Kiwi,25-46,1.0-3.3,Brown,25-50,Omnivore,Forests,"Stoats, Cats",6.4-9.6,New Zealand,Vulnerable,Apterygidae,63-92,9,Solitary,1,"Kiwi are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand of the order Apterygiformes. The five extant species fall into the family Apterygidae and genus Apteryx Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are the smallest ratites (which also include ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries and the extinct elephant birds and moa).

DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed as vulnerable, and one of which is near threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation, but their remaining habitat is well protected in large forest reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.

The vestigial wings are so small as to be invisible under their bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. Kiwi eggs are one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any order of bird in the world. Other unique adaptations of kiwi, such as short and stout legs and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well known.

Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were three species of bat, and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods).

The kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.

This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.

The kiwi is recognised as an icon of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders."
Komodo Dragon,Up to 300,Up to 90,Grey,20-30,Carnivore,"Islands, Grasslands","Humans, Larger Predators",20,Indonesia,Vulnerable,Varanidae,7-8 months,20,Solitary,20-25,"The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a large reptile of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, with the males growing to a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft) and weighing up to 150 kg (330 lb).

The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue. Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail.

As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.

The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 km/h (12 mph), diving up to 4.5 m (15 ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws. To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support. As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.

Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as cannibalistic adults, which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.

Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to contract further from the effects of climate change; hence, they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List. They are protected under Indonesian law, and Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts."
Leaf-tailed Gecko,Up to 25,Up to 250,Various,15,Insectivore,"Rainforests, Madagascar","Birds, Snakes",0.8-1,Madagascar,Not Evaluated,Gekkonidae,45-60,Not Applicable,Solitary,02-Jan,"Uroplatus phantasticus, the satanic leaf-tailed gecko, eyelash leaf-tailed gecko or the phantastic leaf-tailed gecko, is a species of gecko indigenous to the island of Madagascar. First described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger, U. phantasticus is the smallest in body of the Uroplatus geckos, though there is an ongoing debate as to whether one of its cousins, U. ebenaui, is smaller because of its shorter tail.

The species is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is found nowhere else.[4] It is an arboreal animal that relies on its natural camouflage in the northern and central tropical forests of Madagascar.

Its adult size is up to 90mm in total length, including the tail. As with all Uroplatus geckos the tail is flattened, but the leaf-like appearance is only seen in the ebenaui complex (U. phantasticus, U. ebenaui, and U. malama; although the tail size is much reduced in U. ebenaui). In addition, U. phantasticus has an eyelash-like projection above each eye. During daylight hours, these adaptations help the gecko blend into its surroundings. At night it helps the gecko hunt for prey by providing camouflage.

Geckos possess no eyelids, just a transparent covering over their eyes, and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye. The gecko occurs in a variety of colors, including hues of purple, orange, tan and yellow, but is often mottled brown, with small black dots on the underside that help to distinguish it from similar species.

A nocturnal reptile, with suitably large eyes, the leaf-tailed gecko moves about its rainforest habitat at night feeding on insects. The adhesive scales under their fingers and toes and their strong curved claws enable them to move adeptly through the trees. The leaf-tailed gecko is somewhat of an expert at avoiding predators, not only through their incredible mimicry but through a number of behaviours. They can flatten their body against the substrate to reduce the body's shadow, open their jaws wide to show a frightening, bright red mouth, and voluntarily shed their tail in order to trick a predator.

Like many reptiles, the leaf-tailed gecko is oviparous, or egg-laying. Reproduction starts at the beginning of the rainy season when it lays clutches of two spherical eggs onto the ground under leaf litter or in the dead leaves of plants.

Habitat destruction, deforestation, and collection for the pet trade all threaten the existence of this species. Studies suggest that leaf-tailed geckos can only inhabit a very specific environment and are not tolerant of any degradation of their natural habitat. This makes them vulnerable to the impacts of habitat degradation and harvesting, a common problem due to it being popular pets. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the Uroplatus species on their ""Top ten most wanted species list"" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it ""being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade"". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal."
Leafy Sea Dragon,Up to 35,Up to 0.5,"Brown, Green",Up to 10,Carnivore,Seaweed Beds,"Fish, Octopuses",Not Applicable,Southern Australia,Near Threatened,Syngnathidae,30-40,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 300,"The leafy seadragon (Phycodurus eques) or Glauert's seadragon, is a marine fish. It is the only member of the genus Phycodurus in the family Syngnathidae, which includes seadragons, pipefish, and seahorses.

It is found along the southern and western coasts of Australia. The name is derived from their appearance, with long leaf-like protrusions coming from all over the body. These protrusions are not used for propulsion; they serve only as camouflage. The leafy seadragon propels itself utilising a pair of pectoral fins on the sides of its neck and a dorsal fin on its back closer to the tail end. These small fins are almost completely transparent and difficult to see as they undulate minutely to move the creature sedately through the water, completing the illusion of floating seaweed.

Much like the seahorse, the leafy seadragon's name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in this case, the mythical dragon). While not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorses, growing to about 20–24 cm (8–9.5 in). They feed on plankton and small crustaceans. The lobes of skin that grow on the leafy seadragon provide camouflage, giving it the appearance of seaweed. It is able to maintain the illusion when swimming, appearing to move through the water like a piece of floating seaweed. It can also change colour to blend in, but this ability depends on the seadragon's diet, age, location, and stress level.

Leafy seadragons usually live a solitary lifestyle. When the time comes, males court the females, they then pair up to breed. From the moment they hatch, leafy seadragons are completely independent. By the age of two, they are typically full grown and ready to breed. As with seahorses, the male leafy seadragon cares for the eggs. The female produces up to 250 bright pink eggs, then deposits them onto the male's tail with her ovipositor, a long tube. The eggs then attach themselves to a brood patch, which supplies them with oxygen. The species feeds by sucking up small crustaceans, such as amphipods and mysid shrimp, plankton, and larval fish through its long, pipe-like snout.

Popularly known as ""leafies"", they are the marine emblem of the state of South Australia and a focus for local marine conservation. Leafy seadragons are subject to many threats, both natural and man-made. They are caught by collectors, and used in alternative medicine. They are vulnerable when first born, and are slow swimmers, reducing their chance of escaping from a predator. Seadragons are sometimes washed ashore after storms.

The species has become endangered through pollution and industrial runoff, as well as collection for the aquarium trade. In response to these dangers, the species has been totally protected in South Australia since 1987, Victoria since at least 1995, and Western Australia since 1991. Additionally, the species' listing in the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 means that the welfare of the species has to be considered as a part of any developmental project."
Lemur,30-50,0.6-3.5,Various,15-25,Omnivore,"Rainforests, Madagascar","Fossa, Hawks",24-29,Madagascar,Vulnerable,Lemuridae,134-138,29,Group-based,02-Jan,"Lemurs are wet-nosed primates of the superfamily Lemuroidea, divided into 8 families and consisting of 15 genera and around 100 existing species. They are endemic to the island of Madagascar. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees and are active at night.

Lemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from monkeys and apes. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, lemur evolution has produced a level of species diversity rivaling that of any other primate group.

Living lemurs range in weight from the 30-gram (1.1 oz) mouse lemur to the 9-kilogram (20 lb) indri. Since the arrival of humans on the island around 2,000 years ago, over a dozen species of ""giant lemurs"" larger than living lemur species have become extinct, including the gorilla-sized Archaeoindris. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent digits on their hands and feet, and nails instead of claws (in most species). However, their brain-to-body size ratio is smaller than that of anthropoid primates. As with all strepsirrhine primates, they have a ""wet nose"" (rhinarium).

Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, living in groups known as troops. They communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low basal metabolic rate, and as a result may exhibit dormancy such as hibernation or torpor. They also have seasonal breeding and female social dominance. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets.

Lemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used.

Many lemur species remain endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions, such as fady, generally help protect lemurs and their forests, illegal logging, economic privation and political instability conspire to thwart conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that as of 2013 up to 90% of all lemur species confront the threat of extinction in the wild within the next 20 to 25 years. Ring-tailed lemurs are an iconic flagship species. Collectively, lemurs exemplify the biodiverse fauna of Madagascar and have facilitated the emergence of eco-tourism. In addition, conservation organizations increasingly seek to implement community-based approaches to save lemur species and promote sustainability."
Lion-tailed Macaque,45-60,2.5-10,Black,20-30,"Omnivore, Herbivore","Western Ghats, India","Tigers, Leopards",30-40,India,Endangered,Cercopithecidae,150-170,35,Social groups,1,"The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), also known as the wanderoo, is an Old World monkey endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. Lion-tailed macaques are covered in black fur, and have a striking gray or silver mane that surrounds their face which can be found in both sexes. The face itself is hairless and black, being pinkish in infants less than a year old. They are named not for their mane, but for their tail, which is long, thin, and naked, with a lion-like, black tail tuft at the tip. The size of their tail is about 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. Their eyes are a shade of hazelnut with highlighting black eyelids. Lion-tailed macaques, like other macaques, have deep cheek pouches useful for storing food, and are quadrupedal with opposable digits. The mane that surrounds its face gives this monkey its German name Bartaffe – ""beard ape"". With a head-body length of 42–61 cm (17–24 in) and a weight of 2–10 kg (4.4–22.0 lb), it ranks among the smaller macaques species. Offspring are born with lighter faces and no mane, with the adult mane growing in after two months after birth.

The lion-tailed macaque is a rainforest dweller, often being found in the upper canopy of tropical moist evergreen forests or monsoon forests. It is diurnal, meaning it is active exclusively in daylight hours. When they are active, they will spend half the day foraging, and the other half will be spent resting or finding new areas to forage. Unlike other macaques, it typically avoids humans when possible. In group behavior, the lion-tailed macaque is much like other macaques, living in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 members, which usually consist of few males, typically 1-3, and many females. They have a polygynous mating system with no specific breeding season. While there is no specific breeding season, they do tend to breed in the wet season when resources are most abundant. Little time is spent grooming or playing with others in the group. Of the few males, only one will be the dominant male, who will protect his troop from others and be the one who breeds. It is a territorial animal, defending its area first with loud cries and bared teeth towards the invading troops. If this proves to be fruitless, it brawls aggressively, which can result in severe injuries due to lacerations from their large canines. Other forms of communication come in the form of mounting to show strength, branch shaking to scare off, lip-smacking as a friendly greeting, or yawning with a grimace to indicate dominance.

An assessment in 2003 for IUCN reports 3000–3500 of these animals live scattered over several areas in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka. The lion-tailed macaque ranks among the rarest and most threatened primates. Their range has become increasingly isolated and fragmented by the spread of agriculture and tea, coffee, teak and cinchona, construction of water reservoirs for irrigation and power generation, and human settlements to support such activities. They do not live, feed or travel through plantations. Destruction of their habitat and their avoidance of human proximity have led to the drastic decrease of their population."
Lyrebird,80-100,0.9-1.2,"Brown, Black",15-20,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Birds of Prey, Dingoes",0.02-0.03,Australia,Least Concern,Menuridae,50-55,Not Applicable,Solitary,1,"A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus Menura, and the family Menuridae. They are most notable for their impressive ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display. Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds.

The lyrebirds are large passerine birds, amongst the largest in the order. They are ground living birds with strong legs and feet and short rounded wings. They are poor fliers and rarely fly except for periods of downhill gliding. The superb lyrebird is the larger of the two species. Lyrebirds measure 31 to 39 inches in length, including their tail. Males tend to be slightly larger than females. Females weigh around 2 pounds, and males weigh around 2.4 pounds.

The superb lyrebird is found in areas of rainforest in Victoria, New South Wales, and south-east Queensland. It is also found in Tasmania where it was introduced in the 19th century. Many superb lyrebirds live in the Dandenong Ranges National Park and Kinglake National Park around Melbourne, the Royal National Park and Illawarra region south of Sydney, in many other parks along the east coast of Australia, and non protected bushland. Albert's lyrebird is found only in a small area of Southern Queensland rainforest.

Lyrebirds are shy and difficult to approach, particularly the Albert's lyrebird, with the result that little information about its behaviour has been documented. When lyrebirds detect potential danger, they pause and scan the surroundings, sound an alarm, and either flee the area on foot, or seek cover and freeze. Firefighters sheltering in mine shafts during bushfires have been joined by lyrebirds.

Lyrebirds feed on the ground and as individuals. A range of invertebrate prey is taken, including insects such as cockroaches, beetles (both adults and larvae), earwigs, fly larvae, and the adults and larvae of moths. Other prey taken includes centipedes, spiders, earthworms. Less commonly taken prey includes stick insects, bugs, amphipods, lizards, frogs and occasionally, seeds. They find food by scratching with their feet through the leaf-litter.

Until the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season, superb lyrebirds were not considered threatened in the short to medium term. Concern has since grown as early analyses have shown the extent of destruction of the lyrebird's preferred wet-forest habitats, which in less intense previous bushfire seasons have been spared, in large part due to their moisture content. Albert's lyrebird has a very restricted habitat and had been listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, but because the species and its habitat were carefully managed, the species was re-assessed to near threatened in 2009. The superb lyrebird had already been seriously threatened by habitat destruction in the past. Its population had since recovered, but the 2019–2020 bushfires damaged much of its habitat, which may lead to a reclassification of its status from ""common"" to ""threatened"". Beyond this new threat are the long-term vulnerabilities to predation by cats and foxes, as well as human population pressure on its habitat."
Malayan Krait,Up to 150,Up to 2.2,"Black, Yellow",15,Carnivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Mongooses, Birds",Not Applicable,Southeast Asia,Least Concern,Elapidae,180-270,Not Applicable,Solitary,16-Aug,"The Malayan krait or blue krait (Bungarus candidus) is a highly venomous species of snake belonging to the Elapidae family. Found in Southeast Asia, this species inhabits countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Preferring lowland habitats, the Malayan krait thrives in areas near water sources like rice fields, streams, and marshlands, but it can also adapt to forest edges and human settlements. Its elusive and nocturnal nature makes it less commonly encountered by humans during the day.

The Malayan krait is instantly recognizable by its striking coloration. It typically has alternating black and white or creamy bands running the length of its body. These bands serve as a warning to potential predators, signaling its venomous nature. The snake’s slender, cylindrical body is complemented by a relatively small head that is barely distinct from the neck, while its scales are smooth, giving it a glossy appearance. Adult Malayan kraits usually measure 1 to 1.5 meters in length, though some individuals may grow longer.

This snake is primarily nocturnal, becoming active at night to hunt. It preys on small vertebrates such as other snakes, lizards, rodents, and amphibians. The Malayan krait uses its potent venom to immobilize prey, delivering the toxin through its fixed, hollow fangs. Its venom is primarily neurotoxic, targeting the nervous system and causing paralysis. Although this venom is extremely dangerous to humans, bites are relatively rare due to the krait’s reclusive behavior. However, when threatened or cornered, it may bite defensively, posing a significant medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Its mortality rate is 60–70% in untreated humans. The amount of venom injected is 5 mg, while the lethal dose for a 75kg human is 1 mg

Despite its venomous nature, the Malayan krait is not inherently aggressive. It is known for its docile disposition and tendency to avoid confrontation. When threatened, it often curls into a ball and hides its head beneath its body rather than attacking. This behavior reflects its preference to evade rather than engage with potential predators or threats.

The Malayan krait plays an essential role in the ecosystem as both predator and prey. By controlling populations of smaller animals, it helps maintain ecological balance. Its own predators include birds of prey and larger snakes. However, habitat loss, environmental changes, and human persecution pose threats to its population in certain regions.

In folklore and local beliefs, the Malayan krait is often both respected and feared due to its venomous nature. In some communities, sightings of this snake are considered omens. Conservationists emphasize the importance of educating local populations about the krait’s ecological role and encouraging coexistence to ensure its survival in the wild.

While its beautiful and striking appearance may attract attention, the Malayan krait is best observed from a safe distance. Its enigmatic behavior and crucial role in the food chain highlight the intricate balance of biodiversity in Southeast Asia’s ecosystems."
Manatee,300-400,400-590,"Gray, Brown",40-60,Herbivore,"Rivers, Coastal Areas","Alligators, Sharks",8,"North, Central, and South America",Vulnerable,Trichechidae,365-450,8,Solitary,1,"Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing three of the four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to 4.0 metres (13 ft 1 in) long, weigh as much as 590 kilograms (1,300 lb), and have paddle-like tails.

Manatees weigh 400 to 550 kg (880 to 1,210 lb), and average 2.8 to 3.0 m (9 ft 2 in to 9 ft 10 in) in length, sometimes growing to 4.6 m (15 ft 1 in) and 1,775 kg (3,913 lb) and females tend to be larger and heavier than males. The female manatee has two teats, one under each flipper, a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants. The lids of manatees' small, widely spaced eyes close in a circular manner. The manatee has a large, flexible, prehensile upper lip, used to gather food and eat and for social interaction and communication. Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians, the dugongs.

Manatee adults have no incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. These teeth are repeatedly replaced throughout life, with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth, somewhat as elephants' teeth do.
Apart from mothers with their young, or males following a receptive female, manatees are generally solitary animals. Manatees spend approximately 50% of the day sleeping submerged, surfacing for air regularly at intervals of less than 20 minutes. The remainder of the time is mostly spent grazing in shallow waters at depths of 1–2 m (3 ft 3 in – 6 ft 7 in). The Florida subspecies (T. m. latirostris) has been known to live up to 60 years.

Manatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants. Manatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon basin, and West Africa. Manatees are capable of understanding discrimination tasks and show signs of complex associative learning. They also have good long-term memory. They demonstrate discrimination and task-learning abilities similar to dolphins and pinnipeds in acoustic and visual studies. Social interactions between manatees are highly complex and intricate, which may indicate higher intelligence than previously thought, although they remain poorly understood by science.

The main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects. Their slow-moving, curious nature has led to violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships. Some manatees have been found with over 50 scars on them from propeller blades. Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures, predation by crocodiles on young, and disease."
Mandrill,Up to 75,Up to 55,"Brown, Green",20-40,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",30,Central Africa,Vulnerable,Cercopithecidae,175-190,30,Social groups,1,"The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a large Old World monkey native to west central Africa. It is one of the most colorful mammals in the world, with red and blue skin on its face and posterior. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males have a larger body, longer canine teeth and brighter coloring. It is the largest monkey in the world. Its closest living relative is the drill, with which it shares the genus Mandrillus. Both species were traditionally thought to be baboons, but further evidence has shown that they are more closely related to white-eyelid mangabeys.

The mandrill has a stocky body with a large head and muzzle, as well as a short and stumpy tail. The limbs are evenly sized and the fingers and toes are more elongated than those in baboons, with a more opposable big toe on the feet.[21] The mandrill is the most sexually dimorphic primate, and it is the largest monkey. Females are less stocky and have shorter, flatter snouts. Males have a 70–95 cm (28–37 in) head-body length and weigh 19–30 kg (42–66 lb) while females have a 55–70 cm (22–28 in) head-body length and weigh 10–15 kg (22–33 lb).

Mandrills prefer thick bush dominated by perennial plants like gingers and plants of the genera Brillantaisia and Phaulopsis. They mainly dwell on the ground, but feed as high as the canopy. Both mandrills and drills are more arboreal than baboons. Mandrills may aggregate or compete with other primates such as talapoins, guenons, mangabeys, black-and-white colobuses, chimpanzees, and gorillas.

Mandrills are mostly diurnal and are awake around 10 hours per day from morning to dusk. They often pick a new tree to sleep in every night. Mandrills have been observed using tools; in captivity, they use sticks to clean themselves. In the wild, mandrills appear to live 12–14 years, but captive individuals can live 30–40 years. Mandrills live in large ""supergroups"" or ""hordes"" that can contain hundreds of individuals. These large groups are fairly stable and do not appear to be gatherings of smaller ones.

Mandrills mainly live in tropical rainforests but will also travel across savannas. They are active during the day and spend most of their time on the ground. Their preferred foods are fruit and seeds, but mandrills will consume leaves, piths, mushrooms, and animals from insects to juvenile bay duiker. Mandrills live in large, stable groups known as ""hordes"" which can number in the hundreds. Females form the core of these groups, while adult males are solitary and only reunite with the larger groups during the breeding season. Dominant males have the most vibrant colors and fattest flanks and rumps, and have the most success siring young.

The mandrill is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its biggest threats are habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat. Gabon is considered the stronghold for the species. Its habitat has declined in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited."
Maned Wolf,67-107,20-25,Reddish-Brown,8,Omnivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Jaguars, Pumas",56,South America,Near Threatened,Canidae,65-70,56,Solitary,06-Feb,"The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is a large canine of South America. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay, and is almost extinct in Uruguay. Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon.

It is the largest canine in South America, weighing 20–30 kg (44–66 lb) and up to 110 cm (43 in) at the withers. Its long, thin legs and dense reddish coat give it a distinct appearance. The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous animal adapted to the open environments of the South American savanna, with an important role in the seed dispersal of fruits, especially the wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum). The maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by scent marking, but also gives a loud call known as ""roar-barking"".

The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids; its long legs are likely an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its native habitat. Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish-brown to golden orange on the sides with long, black legs, and a distinctive black mane. The coat is marked further with a whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white ""bib"" beneath the throat. The mane is erectile and typically is used to enlarge the wolf's profile when threatened or when displaying aggression. Melanistic maned wolves do exist, but are rare. The first photograph of a black adult maned wolf was taken by a camera trap in northern Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2013.

The maned wolf is a twilight animal, but its activity pattern is more related to the relative humidity and temperature, similar to that observed with the bush dog (Speothos venaticus). Peak activity occurs between 8 and 10 am, and 8 and 10 pm. On cold or cloudy days, they can be active all day. The species is likely to use open fields for foraging and more closed areas, such as riparian forests, to rest, especially on warmer days. Unlike most large canids (such as the gray wolf, the African hunting dog, or the dhole), the maned wolf is a solitary animal and does not form packs. It typically hunts alone, usually between sundown and midnight, rotating its large ears to listen for prey animals in the grass. It taps the ground with a front foot to flush out the prey and pounce to catch it. It kills prey by biting on the neck or back, and shaking the prey violently if necessary.

This mammal lives in open and semi-open habitats, especially grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; northern Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through loss of habitat. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as near threatened, while it is considered a vulnerable species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. In 2011, a female maned wolf, run over by a truck, underwent stem cell treatment at the Zoo Brasília, this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal."
Mantis Shrimp,Up to 30,Up to 2.7,Various,Up to 20,Carnivore,Coral Reefs,Larger Fish,30-50,Oceans worldwide,Not Evaluated,Stomatopoda,20-30,30-50,Solitary,Hundreds,"Mantis shrimp are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda. Stomatopods branched off from other members of the class Malacostraca around 400 million years ago. Mantis shrimp typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in). A mantis shrimp's carapace covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades of brown to vivid colours, with more than 520 species of mantis shrimp known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives sheltering in burrows and holes.

Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time. The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities. These two habitats are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations for consuming their prey. Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating and for keeping their eggs safe. Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal's new diameter. Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud, which can be expanded.

Called ""sea locusts"" by ancient Assyrians, ""prawn killers"" in Australia, and now sometimes referred to as ""thumb splitters"" due to their ability to inflict painful wounds if handled incautiously, mantis shrimp have powerful raptorial appendages that are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified 'clubs' that can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term ""mantis"" in their common name).

Mantis shrimp are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use fluorescent patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with which they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviours to defend their space from rivals.

The mantis shrimp is eaten by a variety of cultures. In Japanese cuisine, the mantis shrimp species Oratosquilla oratoria, called shako, is eaten boiled as a sushi topping, and occasionally raw as sashimi. Mantis shrimps are also abundant along Vietnam's coast, known in Vietnamese as bề bề, tôm tích or tôm tít. In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called bàn chải, named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled, or dried, used with pepper, salt and lime, fish sauce and tamarind, or fennel."
Markhor,Up to 115,Up to 110,"Brown, Gray",13,Herbivore,Mountains,"Wolves, Snow Leopards",40-64,"Central Asia, South Asia, Middle East",Near Threatened,Bovidae,135-170,40-64,Solitary,02-Jan,"The markhor (Capra falconeri) is a large wild Capra (goat) species native to South Asia and Central Asia, mainly within Pakistan, the Karakoram range, parts of Afghanistan, and the Himalayas. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened since 2015. The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw-horn or screw-horned goat.

The word mārkhor , meaning ""snake-eater"", comes from both Pashto and classical Persian languages, referencing the ancient belief that the markhor would actively kill and consume snakes. This regional myth is believed to stem from the ""snake-like"" form of the male markhor's horns, twisting and curling like a snake, possibly leading ancient peoples to associate them with snakes.

Markhor stand 65 to 115 centimetres (26 to 45 in) at the shoulder, are 132 to 186 centimetres (52 to 73 in) long and weigh from 32 to 110 kilograms (71 to 243 lb). They have the highest maximum shoulder height among the species in the genus Capra, but is surpassed in length and weight by the Siberian ibex. The coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black colour, and is smooth and short in summer, while growing longer and thicker in winter. The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Markhor are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to 160 cm (63 in) long, and up to 25 cm (10 in) in females. The males have a pungent smell, which surpasses that of the domestic goat.

Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between 600 and 3,600 m (2,000 and 11,800 ft) in elevation. They typically inhabit shrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and junipers (Juniperus macropoda). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season is during winter, when the males fight each other by lunging, locking of horns, and attempting to push each other off balance.

Markhor live in herds, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19% of the population, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) 9%. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above. In the spring, the females stay closer to cliffs in areas with more rock coverage to provide protection for their offspring. The males stay in higher elevated areas with more access to vegetation for foraging so as to improve their body's condition.

Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Himalayan wolf (Canis lupus chanco) and brown bear (Ursus arctos) are the main predators of the markhor. The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) has been reported to prey upon young markhor. The markhor possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and on high alert; in exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.

On 2 May 2024, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 May as the International Day of the Markhor."
Meerkat,25-35,0.6-1,"Brown, Tan",14,"Omnivore, Insectivore",Arid regions,"Eagles, Jackals",32,"Kalahari Desert, Africa",Least Concern,Herpestidae,70-73,32,Social groups,05-Feb,"The meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose found in southern Africa. It is characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail, and a brindled coat pattern. The head-and-body length is around 24–35 cm (9.4–13.8 in), and the weight is typically between 0.62 and 0.97 kg (1.4 and 2.1 lb). The coat is light grey to yellowish-brown with alternate, poorly-defined light and dark bands on the back. Meerkats have foreclaws adapted for digging and have the ability to thermoregulate to survive in their harsh, dry habitat. Three subspecies are recognised.

Meerkats are highly social, and form packs of two to 30 individuals each that occupy home ranges around 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. Members of a pack take turns at jobs such as looking after pups and keeping a lookout for predators. There is a social hierarchy—generally dominant individuals in a pack breed and produce offspring, and the nonbreeding, subordinate members provide altruistic care to the pups. Breeding occurs around the year, with peaks during heavy rainfall; after a gestation of 60 to 70 days, a litter of three to seven pups is born.

Encounters between members of different packs are highly aggressive, leading to severe injuries and often deaths; 19% of meerkats die by conspecific violence, which is the highest recorded percentage among mammals. Females, often the heaviest ones, try to achieve dominance over the rest in many ways such as fierce competition or taking over from the leader of the pack. A study showed that females who grew faster were more likely to assert dominance, though males did not show such a trend.

They live in rock crevices in stony, often calcareous areas, and in large burrow systems in plains. The burrow systems, typically 5 m (16 ft) in diameter with around 15 openings, are large underground networks consisting of two to three levels of tunnels. These tunnels are around 7.5 cm (3.0 in) high at the top and wider below, and extend up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) into the ground. Burrows have moderated internal temperatures and provide a comfortable microclimate that protects meerkats in harsh weather and at extreme temperatures.

Meerkats are active during the day, mostly in the early morning and late afternoon; they remain continually alert and retreat to burrows when sensing danger. They use a broad variety of calls to communicate among one another for different purposes, for example to raise an alarm on sighting a predator.  The meerkat is primarily an insectivore, feeding heavily on beetles and lepidopterans; it can additionally feed on eggs, amphibians, arthropods (such as scorpions, to whose venom they are immune), reptiles, small birds (such as the southern anteater-chat), plants and seeds. Captive meerkats include plenty of fruits and vegetables in their diet, and also kill small mammals by biting the backs of their skulls.

Commonly living in arid, open habitats with little woody vegetation, meerkats occur in southwestern Botswana, western and southern Namibia, and northern and western South Africa; the range barely extends into southwestern Angola. With no significant threats to the population, the meerkat is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Meerkats are widely depicted in television, movies and other media."
Monitor Lizard,Up to 244,Up to 166,Varies,Varies,Carnivore,Various,"Birds, Snakes",Varies,"Africa, Asia, Australia, Oceania",Varies,Varanidae,Varies,Varies,Solitary,Varies,"Monitor lizards are lizards in the genus Varanus, the only extant genus in the family Varanidae. They are native to Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and one species is also found in the Americas as an invasive species. About 80 species are recognized.

Monitor lizards have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. The adult length of extant species ranges from 20 cm (7.9 in) in some species such as Varanus sparnus, to over 3 m (10 ft) in the case of the Komodo dragon, though the extinct megalania (Varanus priscus) may have reached lengths of more than 7 m (23 ft). Most monitor species are terrestrial, but many are also arboreal or semiaquatic. While most monitor lizards are carnivorous, eating smaller reptiles, fish, birds, insects, small mammals, and eggs, a few species also eat fruit and vegetation.

The various species cover a vast area, occurring through Africa, the Indian subcontinent, to China, the Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan, south to Southeast Asia to Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Australia, and islands of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. They have also been introduced outside of their natural range, for instance, the West African Nile monitor is now found in South Florida.[12] Monitor lizards also occurred widely in Europe in the Neogene, with the last known remains in the region dating to the Middle Pleistocene.

Most monitor lizards are almost entirely carnivorous, consuming prey as varied as insects, crustaceans, arachnids, myriapods, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most species feed on invertebrates as juveniles and shift to feeding on vertebrates as adults. Deer make up about 50% of the diet of adult Komodo dragons, the largest monitor species. In contrast, three arboreal species from the Philippines, Varanus bitatawa, mabitang, and olivaceus, are primarily fruit eaters.

Anatomical and molecular studies indicate that all varanids (and possibly all lizards) are venomous. Unlike snakes, monitor lizard venom glands are situated in their lower jaw. The venom of monitor lizards is diverse and complex, as a result of the diverse ecological niches monitor lizards occupy.

At least some species of monitors are known to be able to count; studies feeding rock monitors varying numbers of snails showed that they can distinguish numbers up to six. Nile monitors have been observed to cooperate when foraging; one animal lures the female crocodile away from her nest, while the other opens the nest to feed on the eggs. The decoy then returns to also feed on the eggs.

According to IUCN Red List of threatened species, most of the monitor lizards species fall in the categories of least concern, but the population is decreasing globally. All but five species of monitor lizards are classified by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora under Appendix II, which is loosely defined as species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade in such species is subject to strict regulation to avoid use incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. The remaining five species – the Bengal, yellow, desert, and clouded monitors and the Komodo Dragon– are classified under CITES Appendix I, which outlaws international commercial trade in the species.

The yellow monitor is protected in all countries in its range except Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. In Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and all other parts of South India, catching or killing of monitor lizards is banned under the Protected Species Act."
Mountain Gorilla,120-200,70-200,"Black, Brown",35-40,Herbivore,"Rainforests, Mountains","Leopards, Humans",40,"Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",Endangered,Hominidae,255-270,40,Group-based,1,"The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2018. There are two populations: One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central/East Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in southwest Uganda; Volcanoes, in northwest Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The other population is found in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists speculate the Bwindi population is a separate subspecies, though no description has been finalized. As of June 2018, there were more than 1,000 individuals.

The fur of the mountain gorilla, often thicker and longer than that of other gorilla species, enables them to live in colder temperatures. Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to each individual. Males reach a standing height of 161–171 cm (63–67 in), a girth of 138–163 cm (54–64 in), an arm span of 2 to 2.7 m (6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 10 in) and a weight of 120–191 kg (265–421 lb). Females are smaller with a weight of 70–98 kg (154–216 lb). This subspecies is smaller than the eastern lowland gorilla, the other subspecies of eastern gorilla. Adult males have more pronounced bony crests on the top and back of their skulls, giving their heads a more conical shape. These crests anchor the powerful temporalis muscles, which attach to the lower jaw (mandible). Adult females also have these crests, but they are less pronounced.

The mountain gorilla is primarily terrestrial and quadrupedal. However, it will climb into fruiting trees if the branches can carry its weight. Like all great apes other than humans, its arms are longer than its legs. It moves by knuckle-walking, supporting its weight on the backs of its curved fingers rather than its palms. The mountain gorilla is diurnal, spending most of the day eating, as large quantities of food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in the early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.

The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest, including the Virunga Mountains, ranging in elevation from 2,200 to 4,300 m (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Most groups live on the slopes of three of the dormant volcanoes: Karisimbi, Mikeno, and Visoke. The home range used by one group of gorillas during one year is influenced by availability of food sources and usually includes several vegetation zones.

The mountain gorilla is primarily a herbivore; the majority of its diet is composed of the leaves, shoots, and stems (85.8%) of 142 plant species. It also feeds on bark (6.9%), roots (3.3%), flowers (2.3%), and fruit (1.7%), as well as small invertebrates. (0.1%). The mountain gorilla is highly social, and lives in relatively stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between adult males and females. Relationships among females are relatively weak. These groups are nonterritorial; the silverback generally defends his group rather than his territory. In the Virunga mountain gorillas, the average length of tenure for a dominant silverback is 4.7 years."
Naked Mole Rat,Up to 9,Up to 80,"Pink, Wrinkled",Up to 32,"Herbivore, Insectivore",Underground Tunnels,"Snakes, Humans",0.03-0.08,East Africa,Least Concern,Heterocephalidae,70,Not Applicable,Eusocial,Up to 28,"The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), also known as the sand puppy, is a burrowing rodent native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, notably in Somali regions. It is closely related to the blesmols and is the only species in the genus Heterocephalus.

The naked mole-rat exhibits a highly unusual set of physiological and behavioral traits that allow it to thrive in a harsh underground environment; most notably its being the only mammalian thermoconformer with an almost entirely ectothermic (cold-blooded) form of body temperature regulation, as well as exhibiting a complex social structure split between reproductive and non-reproductive castes, making it and the closely related Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) the only widely recognized examples of eusociality (the highest classification of sociality) in mammals. The naked mole-rat lacks pain sensitivity in its skin, and has very low metabolic and respiratory rates. It is also remarkable for its longevity and its resistance to cancer and oxygen deprivation.

While formerly considered to belong to the same family as other African mole-rats, Bathyergidae, more recent investigation places it in a separate family, Heterocephalidae. Typical individuals are 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and weigh 30 to 35 grams (1.1 to 1.2 oz). Queens are larger and may weigh well over 50 grams (1.8 oz), the largest reaching 80 grams (2.8 oz). They are well adapted to their underground existence. Their eyes are quite small, and their visual acuity is poor. Their legs are thin and short; however, they are highly adept at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed just behind the teeth, preventing soil from filling their mouths while digging.

About a quarter of their musculature is used in the closing of their jaws while they dig. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin. They lack an insulating layer in the skin. The naked mole-rat is well adapted to the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels of its typical habitat. It has underdeveloped lungs and its hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about 70% that of a mouse, thus using oxygen minimally.

The naked mole-rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, predominantly southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. Clusters averaging 75 to 80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts. The tunnel systems built by naked mole-rats can stretch up to three to five kilometres (2–3 mi) in cumulative length. 

Naked mole-rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as a thousand times the body weight of a typical mole-rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations. A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food—lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines ferment the fibres, allowing otherwise indigestible cellulose to be turned into volatile fatty acids. Naked mole-rats sometimes also eat their own feces. This may be part of their eusocial behavior and a means of sharing hormones from the queen."
Narwhal,Up to 500,Up to 1600,"Gray, Mottled White",50-60,Carnivore,Arctic Waters,"Polar Bears, Orcas",45,Arctic,Near Threatened,Monodontidae,14-16 months,45,Solitary,1,"The narwhal (Monodon monoceros) is a species of toothed whale native to the Arctic. It is the only member of the genus Monodon and one of two living representatives of the family Monodontidae. The narwhal has a similar build to the closely related beluga whale, with which it overlaps in range and can interbreed. It is a stocky cetacean with a relatively blunt snout, a large melon, and a shallow ridge in place of a dorsal fin. Males of this species have a large 1.5–3.0 m (4 ft 11 in – 9 ft 10 in) long tusk, which is a left protruded canine thought to serve as a weapon or as a tool for feeding, attracting mates or sensing water salinity. Specially adapted slow-twitch muscles, along with the jointed neck vertebrae and shallow dorsal ridge allow for easy movement through the Arctic environment, where the narwhal spends extended periods at great depths.

The narwhal has a thickset body with a short, blunt snout, small upcurved flippers, and convex to concave tail flukes. Adults measure in body-to-tail length from 3.0 to 5.5 m (9.8 to 18.0 ft) and weigh 800 to 1,600 kg (1,800 to 3,500 lb). Male narwhals attain sexual maturity at 12 to 20 years of age, reaching a length of 3.5 to 4.0 m (11.5 to 13.1 ft). Females become sexually mature at a younger age, between 8 and 9 years old, when they are about 3.4 m (11 ft) long. On average, males are about 70 cm (28 in) longer and more than 75% heavier than females. Compared with most marine mammals, the narwhal has a higher amount of myoglobin in its body, which facilitates deeper dives. It has a dense layer of blubber, around 50 to 100 mm (2.0 to 3.9 in) thick. This fat accounts for a third of the body mass and helps insulate from cold ocean temperatures. Skeletal muscles in the narwhal are highly adapted for prolonged periods of deep-sea foraging. During such activities, oxygen is reserved in the muscles, which are typically slow-twitch, allowing for endurance and manoeuvrable motion.

The narwhal inhabits the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland and Russia. Every year, it migrates to ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters, and often returns to the same sites in subsequent years. Its diet mainly consists of polar and Arctic cod, Greenland halibut, cuttlefish, shrimp, and armhook squid. Plunging at depths of up to 2,370 m (7,780 ft), the narwhal is among the deepest-diving cetaceans. It travels in groups of three to eight, with aggregations of up to 1,000 occurring in the summer months. It mates in the offshore pack ice from March to May, and the young are born in July or August of the following year. When communicating, a variety of clicks, whistles and knocks are used.

There are an estimated 170,000 living narwhals, and the species is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population is threatened by the effects of climate change, such as the reduction in ice cover, and human activities such as pollution and hunting. The narwhal has been hunted for thousands of years by Inuit in northern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory, and regulated subsistence hunts continue."
Nudibranch,Up to 30,Up to 1,Various,Up to 10,Carnivore,"Oceans, Coral Reefs","Sea Anemones, Predatory Fish",Not Applicable,Oceans worldwide,Not Evaluated,Nudibranchia,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"Nudibranchs belong to the order Nudibranchia, a group of soft-bodied marine gastropod molluscs that shed their shells after their larval stage. They are noted for their often extraordinary colours and striking forms, and they have been given colourful nicknames to match, such as ""clown"", ""marigold"", ""splendid"", ""dancer"", ""dragon"", and ""sea rabbit"". Currently, about 3,000 valid species of nudibranchs are known. Nudibranchs are often casually called sea slugs, as they are a family of opisthobranchs (sea slugs), within the phylum Mollusca (molluscs), but many sea slugs belong to several taxonomic groups that are not closely related to nudibranchs. A number of these other sea slugs, such as the photosynthetic Sacoglossa and the colourful Aglajidae, are often confused with nudibranchs.

Nudibranchs occur in seas worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through temperate and tropical regions, to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. They are almost entirely restricted to salt water, although a few species are known to inhabit lower salinities in brackish water. Nudibranchs live at virtually all depths, from the intertidal zone to depths well over 700 m (2,300 ft). The greatest diversity of nudibranchs is seen in warm, shallow reefs, although one nudibranch species was discovered at a depth near 2,500 m (8,200 ft). Nudibranchs are benthic animals, found crawling over the substrate. The only exceptions to this are the neustonic Glaucus nudibranchs, which float upside down just under the ocean's surface; the pelagic nudibranchs Cephalopyge trematoides, which swim in the water column; and the two species of Phylliroe.

In the course of their evolution, nudibranchs have lost their shells, while developing alternative defence mechanisms. Some species evolved an external anatomy with textures and colours that mimicked surrounding sessile invertebrate animals (often their prey sponges or soft corals) to avoid predators (camouflage). Other nudibranchs, as seen especially well on Chromodoris quadricolor, have an intensely bright and contrasting colour pattern that makes them especially conspicuous in their surroundings. Nudibranchs that feed on hydrozoids can store the hydrozoids' nematocysts (stinging cells) in the dorsal body wall, the cerata. These stolen nematocysts, called kleptocnidae, wander through the alimentary tract without harming the nudibranch. Once further into the organ, the cells are assimilated by intestinal protuberances and brought to specific placements on the creature's hind body. The specific mechanism by which nudibranchs protect themselves from the hydrozoids and their nematocysts is yet unknown, but special cells with large vacuoles probably play an important role.

Nudibranchs are hermaphroditic, thus having a set of reproductive organs for both sexes, but they cannot fertilize themselves. Mating usually takes a few minutes, and involves a dance-like courtship. Nudibranchs typically deposit their eggs within a gelatinous spiral, which is often described as looking like a ribbon.

All known nudibranchs are carnivorous. Some feed on sponges, others on hydroids (e.g. Cuthona), others on bryozoans (phanerobranchs such as Tambja, Limacia, Plocamopherus and Triopha), and some eat other sea slugs or their eggs (e.g. Favorinus) or, on some occasions, are cannibals and prey on members of their own species. Other groups feed on tunicates (e.g. Nembrotha, Goniodoris), other nudibranchs (Roboastra, which are descended from tunicate-feeding species), barnacles (e.g. Onchidoris bilamellata), and anemones (e.g. the Aeolidiidae and other Cladobranchia)."
Numbat,35-45,0.32-1,"Red, White",Up to 5,Insectivore,Eucalyptus Forests,"Foxes, Cats",8,Western Australia,Endangered,Myrmecobiidae,14,8,Solitary,06-Apr,"The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), also known as the noombat or walpurti, is an insectivorous marsupial. It is diurnal and its diet consists almost exclusively of termites. 

The numbat is a small, distinctively-striped animal between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18 in) long, including the tail, with a finely pointed muzzle and a prominent, bushy tail about the same length as its body. Colour varies considerably, from soft grey to reddish-brown, often with an area of brick red on the upper back, and always with a conspicuous black stripe running from the tip of the muzzle through the eye to the base of the small, round-tipped ear. Between four and eleven white stripes cross the animal's hindquarters, which gradually become fainter towards the midback. The underside is cream or light grey, while the tail is covered with long, grey hair flecked with white. Weight varies between 280 and 700 g (9.9 and 24.7 oz).

Unlike most other marsupials, the numbat is diurnal, largely because of the constraints of having a specialised diet without having the usual physical equipment for it. Most ecosystems with a generous supply of termites have a fairly large creature with powerful forelimbs bearing heavy claws. Numbats are not large, and they have five toes on the fore feet, and four on the hind feet. However, like other mammals that eat termites or ants, the numbat has a degenerate jaw with up to 50 very small, nonfunctional teeth, and although it is able to chew, rarely does so, because of the soft nature of its diet.

Like many ant- or termite-eating animals, the numbat has a long and narrow tongue coated with sticky saliva produced by large submandibular glands. A further adaptation to the diet is the presence of numerous ridges along the soft palate, which apparently help to scrape termites off the tongue so they can be swallowed. The digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton.

Although the numbat finds termite mounds primarily using scent, it has the highest visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has a high proportion of cone cells in the retina. These are both likely adaptations for its diurnal habits, and vision does appear to be the primary sense used to detect potential predators.

Numbats are insectivores and subsist on a diet of termites (of the genera Heterotermes, Coptotermes, Amitermes, Microcerotermes, Termes, Paracapritermes, Nasutitermes, Tumulitermes, and Occasitermes). An adult numbat requires up to 20,000 termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the numbat spends most of its time searching for termites. It digs them up from loose earth with its front claws and captures them with its long, sticky tongue.

The species was once widespread across southern Australia, but is now restricted to several small colonies in Western Australia. It is therefore considered an endangered species and protected by conservation programs. Numbats were recently re-introduced to fenced reserves in South Australia and New South Wales. The numbat is the faunal emblem of Western Australia."
Okapi,200-250,200-350,"Brown, White",20-30,Herbivore,Central Africa,"Leopards, Lions",56,Democratic Republic of Congo,Endangered,Giraffidae,440-450,58,Solitary,1,"The okapi, also known as the forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe and zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal that is endemic to the northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. However, non-invasive genetic identification has suggested that a population has occurred south-west of the Congo River as well. It is the only species in the genus Okapia. Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae.

The okapi stands about 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder and has a typical body length around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). Its weight ranges from 200 to 350 kg (440 to 770 lb). It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs, and white ankles. Male okapis have short, distinct horn-like protuberances on their heads called ossicones, less than 15 cm (5.9 in) in length. Females possess hair whorls, and ossicones are absent.

Okapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.

Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, branches, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their 18-inch-long (46 cm) tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes. They prefer to feed in treefall gaps. The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Violaceae.

Okapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Illegal mining and extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin have also led to a decline in populations. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations."
Orangutan,Up to 160,30-82,Reddish-brown,30-45,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Tigers, Humans",12-Jun,"Indonesia, Malaysia",Critically Endangered,Hominidae,230-250,40,Solitary,1,"Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast Asia and South China. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). A third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), was identified definitively in 2017. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which diverged genetically from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.

The name ""orangutan"" (also written orang-utan, orang utan, orangutang, and ourang-outang) is derived from the Malay words orang, meaning ""person"", and hutan, meaning ""forest"". The locals originally used the term for actual forest-dwelling humans, but the word underwent a semantic extension to include apes of the Pongo genus at an early stage in the development of Malay.

The most arboreal of the great apes, orangutans spend most of their time in trees. They have proportionally long arms and short legs, and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. Adult males weigh about 75 kg (165 lb), while females reach about 37 kg (82 lb). Dominant adult males develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes: social bonds occur primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet, but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. They can live over 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.

Most of the day is spent feeding, resting, and travelling. hey start the day feeding for two to three hours in the morning. They rest during midday, then travel in the late afternoon. When evening arrives, they prepare their nests for the night. Potential predators of orangutans include tigers, clouded leopards and wild dogs.

Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes' learning abilities have been studied extensively. There may be distinctive cultures within populations. Orangutans have been featured in literature and art since at least the 18th century, particularly in works that comment on human society. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birut? Galdikas and they have been kept in captive facilities around the world since at least the early 19th century.

All three orangutan species are considered critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching (for bushmeat and retaliation for consuming crops), habitat destruction and deforestation (for palm oil cultivation and logging), and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild."
Pangolin,30-100,Feb-40,"Brown, Yellowish",20,Insectivore,"Grasslands, Forests","Lions, Tigers",32,"Asia, Africa",Critically Endangered,Manidae,240-260,32,Solitary,1,"The pangolin is a unique, nocturnal mammal known for its distinctive, protective scales, which are made of keratin—the same material as human hair and nails. Pangolins belong to the family Manidae and are the only mammals wholly covered in scales. There are eight species of pangolins, found across Asia and Africa, each of which has slightly different physical and behavioral characteristics, but they share the same defining trait: their scales. These scales are used for protection, as the pangolin can curl up into a tight ball when threatened, making it nearly impenetrable to predators. When disturbed, pangolins also release a foul-smelling secretion from their anus, further deterring potential threats.

Pangolins are primarily insectivores, with a diet that consists mainly of ants, termites, and other small invertebrates. They have long, sticky tongues, which can extend up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) beyond their mouths, allowing them to probe deep into ant hills or termite mounds. Their tongues are specialized to reach into narrow spaces, and they have no teeth, so they rely on their muscular stomachs to grind up food. Pangolins have powerful forelimbs equipped with sharp claws, which they use to dig into the ground or to tear open insect nests. These claws are also helpful for climbing trees in species that live in forested habitats.

Pangolins are solitary animals, typically living alone except during the mating season or when a mother is caring for her young. They are generally nocturnal, coming out to forage at night when their insect prey is most active. They use their keen sense of smell to locate food and are often seen rummaging through the soil or scouring the bases of trees for their next meal. While most pangolin species are terrestrial, some species are arboreal, spending much of their time in trees. They are also skilled climbers, using their sharp claws to scale tree trunks in search of food.

The reproductive behavior of pangolins is relatively discreet. Female pangolins give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that varies between species, but is generally between 70 and 140 days. The young are born with soft scales that harden as they grow. Pangolin mothers care for their offspring by nursing them and protecting them from potential predators. The young pangolins stay with their mothers for several months before becoming more independent.

Despite their unique adaptations, pangolins are under severe threat due to illegal hunting and trafficking. They are one of the most trafficked mammals in the world, primarily for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in some cultures, and for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine. This demand, especially in Asia, has led to a dramatic decline in pangolin populations. In addition to human persecution, pangolins also face habitat loss due to deforestation, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa, which further threatens their survival.

Conservation efforts for pangolins focus on raising awareness about the illegal wildlife trade and protecting their natural habitats. International organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Traffic, have been working to strengthen laws and enforcement against pangolin trafficking. Many pangolin species are now listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Several countries in Africa and Asia have implemented laws to protect pangolins, and some are working with local communities to reduce the demand for pangolin products through education and alternative livelihoods."
Patagonian Mara,45-75,5.5-16,"Brown, Gray",10,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Foxes, Birds of Prey",30,"Argentina, Chile",Least Concern,Caviidae,75-80,30,Group-based,03-Jan,"The Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), also known as the Patagonian cavy or Patagonian long-tailed cavy, is a unique and endangered species of rodent native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Argentina, particularly in the Patagonian steppe. It belongs to the Caviidae family, which also includes guinea pigs and other cavies. The Patagonian mara is notable for its striking appearance, with long, slender legs, large ears, and a long tail, making it look somewhat like a small antelope. Adult mara typically weigh between 8 to 16 kilograms (18 to 35 pounds) and measure about 60 to 80 cm (24 to 31 inches) in length, with a tail that adds an additional 20 cm (8 inches). Their coat is a mix of pale brown and gray, with white underparts and distinctive black markings on the tail and legs.

Unlike most rodents, which are solitary or form loose family groups, Patagonian maras are highly social animals that live in family groups or small herds. These groups often consist of a breeding pair and their offspring, although larger groups of up to 20 individuals have been observed. The social structure of the Patagonian mara is one of the factors that make it particularly vulnerable to threats, as the loss of habitat or disturbance can have a major impact on group dynamics. The maras communicate with each other through a series of vocalizations, body postures, and scent marking, which help maintain social bonds and defend their territory.

The Patagonian mara is herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, and shrubs that grow in its dry, open habitat. Their diet consists mainly of vegetation, and they are especially fond of certain plants like the forage grasses of the Patagonian steppe. While they can graze during the day, they tend to be more active in the early morning and late afternoon to avoid the heat of the midday sun. As prey animals, maras have developed several strategies to avoid predators. They rely on their speed and agility to escape danger, running at high speeds in a zigzag pattern to evade predators such as foxes, pumas, and birds of prey. Their large ears and excellent sense of hearing help them detect approaching threats.

The reproductive habits of Patagonian maras are also interesting. They are monogamous, with males and females forming long-lasting pair bonds. After a gestation period of about 90 days, females give birth to one or two young, known as kits. The kits are born fully furred and with their eyes open, and they are able to walk shortly after birth. The mother cares for her young by providing milk, and the pair’s bond remains strong as they raise the kits. At around 6 months of age, the young maras become independent, although they often remain within the same social group for a time before forming their own families.

Despite their remarkable adaptations, Patagonian maras are considered near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss, hunting, and human encroachment. The expansion of agriculture, livestock farming, and urbanization has led to significant reductions in their natural range. Additionally, the introduction of non-native predators, such as domestic dogs, and the hunting of maras for their meat and pelts have further contributed to their declining population. While the Patagonian mara is not as heavily hunted as some other species, its vulnerability to these factors makes it a species of concern.

Conservation efforts for the Patagonian mara are focused on protecting its habitat and reducing human-wildlife conflict. Efforts are underway to establish protected areas and reserves within the species' native range, such as the Patagonia National Park, to ensure that the maras have safe places to live and breed."
Peacock Mantis Shrimp,Up to 18,Up to 0.4,Various,Up to 20,Carnivore,Coral Reefs,"Fish, Crustaceans",72,Indo-Pacific region,Not Evaluated,Gonodactylidae,6-9 weeks,72,Solitary,"Up to 10,000","The peacock mantis shrimp (Odontodactylus scyllarus) is a species of mantis shrimp known for its vibrant coloration and impressive hunting abilities. Native to the Indo-Pacific region, particularly coral reefs in the tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, this species is a small yet strikingly beautiful marine crustacean. Adult peacock mantis shrimp typically grow to a length of about 18 centimeters (7 inches), with males generally being slightly smaller than females. Their body is adorned with brilliant colors, ranging from iridescent blues, greens, and reds to yellows and oranges, making them one of the most colorful animals in the ocean. This stunning coloration is due to specialized pigments and structural coloration that reflect light in unique ways.

Mantis shrimp are notorious for their incredible striking abilities, and the peacock mantis shrimp is no exception. It is known for having the fastest and most powerful punch in the animal kingdom, with a pair of specialized forelimbs, called ""raptorial appendages,"" that it uses to strike prey. These appendages function similarly to a spring-loaded weapon, capable of delivering a punch that accelerates at speeds of over 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) in just a few milliseconds. The punch is so forceful that it can break through hard shells of prey, such as snails, clams, and even the tough exoskeletons of other crustaceans. The force of the punch also generates cavitation bubbles—small bubbles that form when the appendage moves through the water at high speed—creating shockwaves that add additional pressure to the attack. This makes the peacock mantis shrimp's strike not only fast but incredibly effective at incapacitating prey.

The peacock mantis shrimp's punch is not only an efficient hunting tool but also an example of nature's engineering prowess. The structure of its raptorial appendages is incredibly complex, consisting of layers of material designed for maximum impact and durability. The appendage is reinforced with a hard, chitinous exoskeleton and shock-absorbing structures that allow it to withstand repeated use without breaking. Research has shown that the mantis shrimp's limbs are so resilient that they can strike thousands of times without significant wear, a phenomenon that has inspired studies in material science and engineering.

In addition to their physical power, peacock mantis shrimp are also known for their remarkable vision. They possess one of the most complex visual systems in the animal kingdom, with 16 types of photoreceptor cells compared to the three found in humans. This allows them to see a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet light, and they are believed to be capable of detecting polarized light. This exceptional vision is thought to aid in communication and mate selection, as well as in locating prey and navigating the complex environments of coral reefs. Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks, which can move independently, providing them with an almost panoramic view of their surroundings.

Peacock mantis shrimp are primarily carnivorous and solitary hunters, using their powerful strike to capture prey. They are also opportunistic feeders, and when a suitable meal is not immediately available, they will retreat to their burrows and wait for an opportunity to ambush prey. These burrows, which they dig into the seafloor or into coral, serve as both hunting grounds and shelters. The mantis shrimp will often return to their burrows after hunting to rest or molt. They are known to be territorial and may aggressively defend their burrows from other mantis shrimp or predators."
Pink Fairy Armadillo,15-Sep,Up to 120,Pink,8,Insectivore,Grasslands,"Foxes, Birds of Prey",Not Applicable,Argentina,Near Threatened,Chlamyphoridae,60-64,Not Applicable,Solitary,1,"The pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus) is a small, elusive species of armadillo native to the central and northern regions of Argentina. It is the smallest of all armadillo species, typically measuring around 13 to 15 centimeters (5 to 6 inches) in length, not including its tail. Its most distinctive feature is its soft, pale pinkish shell, which gives the species its name. Unlike the armored exterior of most armadillos, the pink fairy armadillo's shell is relatively thin and flexible, made of a thin layer of keratin. The shell is attached loosely to its body, with a separation at the middle, allowing the armadillo to bend and move more easily. The pale pink coloration of the shell contrasts with its soft, fur-covered underside and its tiny, almost mouse-like features, giving it an almost magical appearance.

Pink fairy armadillos are nocturnal and highly secretive creatures, spending most of their time underground in burrows that they dig with their powerful claws. They have a specialized body adapted for burrowing, with short, stout limbs and large, curved foreclaws that allow them to dig into the loose, sandy soils of their arid and semi-arid habitats. These burrows provide shelter and protection from the harsh heat during the day and serve as a safe haven from predators. Pink fairy armadillos are solitary animals, only coming together to mate. Their primary food source consists of insects, especially ants, larvae, and termites, which they find in the soil. They use their keen sense of smell to locate their prey and can quickly dig into the ground to uncover hidden insects.

Due to their nocturnal nature and the remote areas in which they live, pink fairy armadillos are difficult to study in the wild. Little is known about their social behavior or specific reproductive patterns. However, it is believed that, like other armadillo species, pink fairy armadillos give birth to a single offspring at a time. The babies, called pups, are born with soft, undeveloped shells that gradually harden as they mature. This process of shell development is gradual, as the pups grow, becoming more independent once they are fully matured. Pink fairy armadillos are not known to be aggressive; however, they are shy and will attempt to escape from danger by quickly retreating into their burrows.

The pink fairy armadillo is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Their native habitats, which are typically dry, sandy plains or grasslands, are increasingly threatened by human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, and the expansion of infrastructure. Additionally, the pink fairy armadillo’s limited distribution range further contributes to its vulnerability. In some areas, they are also at risk of being accidentally trapped in agricultural equipment or disturbed by land development. The lack of sufficient protective measures in these regions poses a significant challenge to the survival of the species."
Platypus,15-Oct,0.7-2.4,Brown,17,"Carnivore, Insectivore",Eastern Australia,"Foxes, Birds of Prey",07-Mar,Australia,Near Threatened,Ornithorhynchidae,10 days (in burrow),9,Solitary,1-3 (rarely 5),"The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is one of the most unique and fascinating animals in the world, native to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It is a monotreme, a rare group of egg-laying mammals, which places it in a distinct evolutionary category separate from other mammals that give birth to live young. The platypus is often described as an ""odd"" or ""hybrid"" animal due to its combination of features from various animal groups, making it a natural curiosity for scientists and animal enthusiasts alike.

One of the platypus's most recognizable characteristics is its duck-bill—a broad, flat, leathery snout that resembles the beak of a duck. This bill is highly sensitive and contains electroreceptors that allow the platypus to detect electrical signals produced by the movements of prey in the water. This specialized adaptation helps the platypus hunt underwater, even in total darkness. Despite its duck-like appearance, the platypus is a mammal and has fur instead of feathers. Its fur is dense and waterproof, providing insulation to keep the animal warm in its aquatic environment. The platypus also has webbed feet, which make it an efficient swimmer. When it swims, the platypus uses its front feet like paddles, while its back feet and tail are used for steering.

The platypus is a semi-aquatic animal, spending much of its time in rivers, lakes, and streams, where it forages for food. It feeds primarily on small invertebrates such as insects, worms, and crustaceans, and it is known to hunt by diving underwater. The platypus is an expert at using its bill to detect prey, even in the absence of sight, relying heavily on its electroreception to locate and capture food. It has a very high metabolic rate and must consume large amounts of food to sustain its energy needs, often eating up to half its body weight in a day. Once it catches its prey, the platypus stores it in special pouches located at the back of its jaw, as it does not have teeth. Instead, it uses grinding pads in its mouth to crush its food.

Another interesting aspect of the platypus is its reproductive behavior. Female platypuses lay eggs, a rare trait among mammals. After mating, the female lays one to three eggs and incubates them in a burrow for about ten days. The eggs are leathery rather than hard, similar to those of reptiles. Once the eggs hatch, the mother nurses her young, but instead of using nipples (like most mammals), she secretes milk through openings in her skin, and the young lap it up directly from the skin. The young are born without fur and are very small, relying completely on the mother's care until they are old enough to swim and forage for themselves.

Despite their unique biology and abilities, platypuses face several threats in the wild. Habitat destruction, pollution, and the effects of climate change are some of the main threats to their populations. The platypus’s reliance on clean, fresh water means that any changes to the quality or availability of water can have a significant impact on its survival. Additionally, the introduction of invasive species, such as non-native predators, can pose a danger to the platypus’s survival. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their natural habitats, regulating water quality, and mitigating the effects of human activities in the areas where platypuses are found."
Polar Bear,Up to 160,Up to 700,White,25-30,Carnivore,Arctic,Orcas,40,Arctic,Vulnerable,Ursidae,195-265,40,Solitary,02-Jan,"The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is one of the most iconic and powerful animals in the Arctic, well adapted to life in one of the harshest environments on Earth. As the largest land carnivore, adult male polar bears can weigh up to 700 kilograms (1,500 pounds), with females typically being about half that size. They are characterized by their thick white fur, which serves as both camouflage in the snowy environment and as insulation against the extreme cold. Beneath their fur, polar bears have a thick layer of blubber that helps them maintain their body heat in subzero temperatures. Their paws are large and covered in dense fur, which helps to distribute their weight when walking on ice and snow and provides traction. The thick fur and blubber make them excellent swimmers, enabling them to move easily through icy waters in search of food.

Polar bears are primarily found in the Arctic Circle, where they roam across the sea ice and along the coasts of the northern polar regions. They are carnivores and have specialized hunting techniques that allow them to survive in this icy environment. The polar bear's diet primarily consists of seals, particularly ringed and bearded seals, which they hunt on the sea ice. They rely on a technique called still hunting, where they wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to surface for air. Once the seal appears, the polar bear strikes with incredible speed and force, catching its prey with its powerful jaws. Polar bears are skilled swimmers, often traveling long distances between ice floes or searching for seals in open water, diving to depths of over 3 meters (10 feet) to catch their prey.

The reproductive habits of polar bears are also adapted to their cold environment. Female polar bears give birth in dens made of snow and ice, where they spend several months in hibernation-like conditions while caring for their newborn cubs. After a gestation period of about eight months, the female typically gives birth to two cubs, though the litter can vary in size. The cubs are born blind, small, and underdeveloped, weighing only about 600 grams (1.3 pounds). The mother nurses them in the den, and they remain with her for up to two and a half years, learning survival skills such as hunting and navigating the icy landscape. Once the cubs are old enough to accompany their mother, they begin to venture out onto the sea ice, although they are still dependent on her for survival during the early years of their life.

Polar bears are solitary animals, except for mothers with cubs and occasional interactions between males and females during the mating season. They are territorial to some degree, and while they may overlap in their home ranges, they are often spread out across vast areas, especially in regions where the sea ice is extensive. Their main mode of travel is walking, although they can run at speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in short bursts when necessary. They are also excellent swimmers, capable of covering great distances in open water, sometimes swimming for hours or even days to reach new areas.

Despite their adaptations, polar bears are increasingly threatened by climate change. As the Arctic warms, the sea ice on which they depend for hunting, breeding, and travel is melting at an alarming rate. The loss of ice cover limits their access to their primary food source, seals, and forces them to travel greater distances to find food, putting increased stress on their populations. As sea ice melts earlier in the year and forms later, polar bears are often forced to spend more time on land, where food is scarce. This forces them into closer proximity to human settlements, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict. In addition, the warming of the Arctic has caused shifts in the distribution of prey species, making it more difficult for polar bears to find food and survive."
Potoo,21-58,0.2-1,"Gray, Brown",15,"Carnivore, Insectivore","Forests, Woodlands",Birds of Prey,16-24,Central and South America,Least Concern,Nyctibiidae,20-30,16-24,Solitary,1,"The potoo is a fascinating and mysterious bird that belongs to the family Nyctibiidae, found primarily in the forests and tropical regions of Central and South America. Known for their cryptic behavior and remarkable camouflage, potoos are nocturnal birds that are most active during the night, making them elusive and difficult to observe in the wild. There are several species of potoos, including the northern potoo (Nyctibius jamaicensis) and the great potoo (Nyctibius grandis), each exhibiting slightly different physical characteristics but sharing similar adaptations to their nocturnal and arboreal lifestyle.

One of the most striking features of potoos is their exceptional camouflage. During the day, they perch motionless on tree stumps, branches, or other vertical surfaces, blending seamlessly with the surrounding environment. Their plumage is designed to mimic the texture and color of tree bark, leaves, and moss, offering protection from predators. Their long, mottled feathers, especially on the head and body, help them resemble the rough surface of trees or branches, making them nearly impossible to detect unless closely examined. This camouflage is essential for survival, as their main defense against threats is to remain still and avoid detection rather than flight.

Potoos are insectivores, feeding mainly on flying insects such as moths, beetles, and mosquitoes, which they catch in mid-air during the night. They use their large, wide mouths to capture prey, often in a manner similar to other night-hunting birds like nightjars. Their mouths are equipped with bristle-like feathers that help funnel insects toward their throats. While their foraging behavior is adapted to nighttime activity, they are generally not strong fliers. Instead, they rely on their ability to remain still and blend into their surroundings, often hunting from perches where they wait for insects to fly close enough to capture.

The breeding behavior of potoos is equally fascinating. Potoos typically nest in tree cavities or on horizontal branches, laying a single egg at a time. Both parents share responsibility for incubating the egg, which is usually camouflaged in the same way as the adults. When a young potoo hatches, it is fed a diet of insects brought by both parents. The young bird stays close to the nest for several weeks, gradually becoming more independent as it learns to hunt and navigate the forest at night. Their cryptic behavior extends to their nesting sites, as they are often located in remote, hard-to-reach areas that are well concealed from potential predators.

Potoos' vocalizations are another unique aspect of their behavior. Their calls are eerie and haunting, often described as a deep, resonating ""whoop"" or ""boo"" that echoes through the forest at night. These vocalizations are typically used by males to establish territory and attract mates. The calls can be heard over long distances, and the haunting quality adds to the bird's mysterious reputation.

Despite their adaptability and camouflage, potoos face threats from habitat destruction and deforestation, particularly in regions where their forest habitats are being cleared for agriculture or urban development. While they are not yet considered endangered, the loss of their natural environment poses a significant risk to their populations. In some areas, they are also impacted by hunting, as their unusual appearance and calls sometimes make them targets for local people who may misunderstand their role in the ecosystem.

Praying Mantis,Up to 15,0.02-0.5,Various,12,Carnivore,Worldwide,"Birds, Spiders",0.5-0.7,Worldwide,Not Evaluated,Mantidae,Oct-60,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 400,"The praying mantis is a predatory insect belonging to the order Mantodea, known for its distinctive appearance and behavior. Its name comes from its characteristic ""praying"" posture, where it folds its forearms together as if in prayer, although this stance is actually a defensive or hunting position. With over 2,400 species found across the world, mantises can be found in a wide range of environments, from tropical rainforests to temperate gardens and grasslands. They are particularly common in areas with dense vegetation, where they can remain well camouflaged while hunting.

Physically, praying mantises are remarkable for their elongated bodies and triangular heads, which give them a unique, almost alien appearance. Their heads are mobile, capable of turning 180 degrees, allowing them to scan their surroundings for prey with exceptional agility. The mantis's large, front legs are modified for grasping prey and are armed with spines that help secure and hold onto their catch. These forelegs are a key feature of the mantis, enabling it to snatch and immobilize prey with lightning speed. The mantis’s hind legs are long and slender, designed for jumping or grasping onto plants and other surfaces.

Praying mantises are carnivorous predators, primarily feeding on other insects, though some larger species are known to catch small vertebrates, such as lizards, frogs, and even birds. They use a method called ambush predation to hunt, typically remaining motionless on a plant or other surface while waiting for prey to come within striking range. When an insect or small animal approaches, the mantis strikes with incredible speed, capturing it in its spiny forelegs. Once the prey is secured, the mantis uses its powerful jaws, or mandibles, to tear apart its food. This method of predation is highly effective, and mantises are skilled at capturing a wide variety of insects, including flies, grasshoppers, and even other, smaller mantises.

Mating behavior in praying mantises is often described as fascinating and sometimes dramatic. In many species, females are known to exhibit sexual cannibalism, where they may eat the male after or during mating. While not universal among all species, this behavior is often observed in captivity and in certain wild populations. The reasons for sexual cannibalism are not fully understood, but it is believed that the female may gain nutritional benefits from the male, which can increase the chances of successful reproduction. After mating, the female will lay her eggs in a protective casing known as an ootheca, which can contain anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred eggs. The ootheca is usually attached to a plant or other surface and hardens to protect the developing embryos. The young mantises, known as nymphs, hatch from the eggs in the spring and resemble miniature adults but without wings. As they grow, they shed their exoskeletons through a process called molting, eventually reaching their adult form.

While praying mantises are widespread and adaptable, they are not without their predators. Birds, frogs, and even larger insects may prey upon mantises. Their most effective defense against these threats is their ability to blend into their environment. Many mantis species are excellent at camouflaging themselves on plants, tree branches, or flowers, where they resemble the surrounding foliage, making them difficult for predators to spot. Some species also exhibit mimicry, such as resembling flowers, which allows them to ambush pollinators like bees and butterflies."
Proboscis Monkey,45-75,14-24,"Orange, Brown",Up to 15,Herbivore,"Mangroves, Rainforests",Clouded Leopards,24-32,"Borneo, Malaysia",Endangered,Cercopithecidae,166-200,24-32,Social groups,1,"The proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) is a distinctive and unique species of monkey found only in the rainforests of Borneo, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. Known for its large, prominent nose, this species stands out as one of the most striking primates in the world. Males, in particular, have an especially large, fleshy nose that hangs down over their mouth. The size of the nose is believed to play a role in attracting mates, as a larger nose is thought to signal better health and genetic fitness. Females, in contrast, have smaller, more subtle noses. In addition to their remarkable noses, proboscis monkeys have pot-bellied physiques, long tails, and a reddish-brown coat, which further enhances their unusual appearance.

Proboscis monkeys are arboreal and semi-terrestrial, spending a significant portion of their time in the trees, but also foraging on the ground. They are well adapted to their forested habitat, with long, strong limbs and a prehensile tail that helps them navigate through the canopy. Their diet primarily consists of leaves, fruit, seeds, and some flowers, with a preference for young leaves that are easier to digest. Unlike many other primates, proboscis monkeys have a specialized digestive system that helps them process the fibrous plant material they consume. Their large stomachs are home to a complex system of bacteria that break down cellulose and other difficult-to-digest compounds, making them efficient at extracting nutrients from their food.

The proboscis monkey is a social species, typically found in troops of around 10 to 30 individuals, although larger groups may form in areas with abundant food. These troops are usually composed of females, their young, and a few adult males. Males are generally solitary or form small bachelor groups. The social structure of proboscis monkeys is hierarchical, with dominant males leading the groups and having exclusive mating rights with the females. The presence of large, dominant males in the troop plays a role in protecting the group from predators, as their size and strength deter potential threats. The monkeys communicate with each other through a range of vocalizations, including grunts, honks, and loud calls. The males' large noses may also contribute to the resonant quality of their calls, which can carry over long distances.

The reproduction of proboscis monkeys is relatively slow compared to other species. Females typically give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of about 166 days. The newborns are born with pink skin and gradually develop their distinctive coloration and physical features as they grow. The young are dependent on their mothers for food and protection for the first few months of their lives. After birth, the mother carries the infant on her belly for a period before the young monkey starts exploring and feeding on its own.

Unfortunately, proboscis monkeys face numerous threats to their survival. They are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of their natural rainforest habitat has been cleared for agriculture, logging, and the development of palm oil plantations. This loss of habitat not only reduces the available food sources for proboscis monkeys but also isolates populations, making it harder for them to find mates and maintain genetic diversity. Hunting is also a problem in some areas, as the monkeys are sometimes killed for meat or their distinctive noses, which are considered a unique feature in local folklore."
Pronghorn,81-104,40-70,"Brown, White",15,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Coyotes, Bobcats",88.5,North America,Least Concern,Antilocapridae,240,88.5,Group-based,1,"The pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) is a unique and highly specialized species of antelope native to the North American plains. Known for its remarkable speed, the pronghorn is often considered the second fastest land mammal in the world, after the cheetah. It can run at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) in short bursts and sustain speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour (48 to 64 kilometers per hour) for longer distances. This incredible speed is an adaptation to evade predators, particularly the now-extinct American cheetah, with which pronghorns once coexisted. Today, their primary predators are wolves, cougars, and bobcats, but their speed allows them to escape most threats effectively.

Physically, pronghorns are medium-sized herbivores with slender bodies and long legs, built for high-speed running. They have a distinct appearance, with a tan or light brown coat and white markings on their belly, throat, and around their eyes. One of their most notable features is their horns, which are different from those of other antelopes or deer. Male pronghorns have a set of horns that are forked, with a bony core covered by a sheath of keratin. The horns are shed and regrown each year, unlike true antlers. Females also have horns, but they are generally smaller and less developed than those of males. These horns are used in social displays and, during the breeding season, in battles between males to establish dominance and secure mating rights.

Pronghorns are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, shrubs, and forbs. Their diet is adapted to the open, arid landscapes of North America, where they can find sufficient food to sustain their high metabolism. They are able to extract moisture from the plants they eat, enabling them to survive in areas where water sources may be scarce. Pronghorns are also known for their ability to adapt to changes in food availability, as they can switch between different types of vegetation depending on the season and environmental conditions.

Pronghorns are social animals, typically found in herds that vary in size depending on the season. In the summer, they form larger groups, while in the winter, they tend to break into smaller, more cohesive units. The structure of the herds is often organized by sex, with females and their young forming one group and adult males forming another. During the breeding season, males compete for access to females, and dominant males will often form ""leks,"" or breeding territories, where they display to attract females. The mating rituals involve a combination of postures, vocalizations, and sometimes physical contests to assert dominance. After mating, females give birth to a single fawn, typically in late spring or early summer, and they raise their young in the safety of the herd.

Despite their speed and adaptability, pronghorns face several challenges in the wild. One of the biggest threats to their populations is habitat loss due to human development, agricultural expansion, and urbanization. As their natural habitats are altered or fragmented, pronghorns are forced to adapt to new environments, which can affect their access to food and migration routes. In addition, barriers such as fences and roads can hinder their ability to migrate or move freely across the landscape. Pronghorns are also vulnerable to hunting and predation, particularly in areas where their population densities are high and their natural predators are present."
Pufferfish,Up to 60,Up to 0.8,Various,10,Carnivore,Tropical and Subtropical,"Sharks, Humans",8,Oceans worldwide,Not Evaluated,Tetraodontidae,Not Applicable,8,Solitary,Not Applicable,"The pufferfish is a fascinating and unique species of fish known for its remarkable ability to inflate its body when threatened, transforming into a spiny, ball-shaped form to deter predators. Belonging to the family Tetraodontidae, pufferfish are found in both marine and freshwater environments, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions across the world. There are over 120 species of pufferfish, with various adaptations depending on their environment. While some species are relatively small and can be found in shallow coastal waters, others inhabit deeper ocean areas or rivers and lakes.

One of the most iconic features of the pufferfish is its ability to inflate its body. When faced with danger, it quickly gulps water (or air, in the case of some species) into its stomach, causing its body to expand rapidly. This inflation increases its size and makes it difficult for predators to swallow, while sharp spines on its skin further enhance its defensive mechanism. The pufferfish's ability to puff up is due to its highly elastic stomach, which can stretch significantly. While this defense is effective against many predators, it is important to note that inflation requires a lot of energy, and the pufferfish is vulnerable during the process.

Another key feature of pufferfish is their toxicity. Pufferfish are infamous for containing a potent neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin in their tissues, particularly in the liver, ovaries, and skin. This toxin is extremely deadly, being more poisonous than cyanide, and it serves as a powerful defense against predators. Interestingly, not all pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin, and the level of toxicity can vary depending on the species and diet. Some pufferfish may acquire tetrodotoxin through consuming certain bacteria or marine organisms that produce it. Despite its toxicity, certain species of pufferfish are considered a delicacy in some countries, notably Japan, where the dish known as fugu is prepared by licensed chefs trained to safely remove the toxic parts of the fish.

Pufferfish are omnivorous feeders, typically eating a wide variety of foods, including algae, mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. They have strong, fused teeth that resemble a beak, which are effective for crushing hard-shelled prey like snails and clams. Their teeth grow continuously throughout their lives, and they must constantly gnaw on objects to keep them from becoming too long. Their diet and feeding habits contribute to their important role in their ecosystems, as they help maintain the balance of populations of smaller organisms.

The reproductive behavior of pufferfish varies among species. In general, pufferfish reproduce through external fertilization, with males releasing sperm into the water to fertilize the eggs laid by females. Some species, such as the Japanese pufferfish, engage in elaborate courtship displays, where males create intricate patterns on the seafloor to attract females. In certain species, males also guard the nests and protect the eggs until they hatch. The larvae of pufferfish are usually planktonic, drifting with ocean currents until they grow large enough to settle into their adult habitats.

Pufferfish are often solitary and territorial, preferring to live alone or in small groups. They are typically slow-moving and spend a significant amount of time searching for food in sandy or rocky substrates. However, their ability to inflate and their potent toxins are not the only ways they defend themselves. In some cases, pufferfish can also produce a disturbing sound by quickly expelling water from their gills, creating a jet-like effect to startle predators."
Quokka,40-54,2.5-5,"Brown, Gray",10,Herbivore,"Scrublands, Forests","Foxes, Cats",24,Australia,Vulnerable,Macropodidae,25-30,24,Solitary,1,"The quokka (Setonix brachyurus) is a small, herbivorous marsupial native to Australia, often referred to as the ""world's happiest animal"" due to its characteristic smile and friendly, approachable demeanor. These nocturnal creatures belong to the family Macropodidae, which includes kangaroos and wallabies, and are mainly found on small, protected islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest Island, where they are most commonly seen. They were first discovered by Dutch explorers in the 17th century, who mistakenly thought they were rats due to their small size and the way they scurried, hence the name ""Rottnest"" meaning ""rat's nest.""

Quokkas are relatively small, with adults typically weighing between 2.5 to 5 kilograms (5.5 to 11 pounds) and measuring about 40 to 54 cm (16 to 21 inches) in body length, with a short tail of around 25 cm (10 inches). Their fur is soft and thick, typically a brown or grey color with lighter underparts, providing camouflage in their natural habitat. Their most striking feature is their round face and wide, upturned mouth, which often gives the appearance of a smile, contributing to their reputation as a happy and friendly animal. They also have large, dark eyes and short, rounded ears that add to their cute and approachable look.

As herbivores, quokkas feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, seeds, and some fruits. They have a preference for shrubs and other low-lying plants that they can easily access. Their diet is primarily made up of plant material that is rich in moisture, helping them survive in the relatively dry conditions of their island habitats. Quokkas are known to graze during the cooler hours of the evening and night, avoiding the heat of the day. They are well adapted to their environment, with their strong hind legs and large feet helping them navigate through dense vegetation and rocky terrain.

Quokkas are marsupial mammals, meaning that, like kangaroos, they give birth to small, underdeveloped young that continue to grow and develop in the mother’s pouch. The gestation period is about a month, and the young, called joeys, remain in the pouch for several months after birth. Once they are large enough to leave the pouch, joeys continue to suckle from their mother for up to six months, though they begin to venture out and graze alongside her much earlier. Quokkas typically give birth to one joey at a time, and breeding can occur year-round, though it is often more common during the warmer months.

Quokkas are notoriously resilient but face some threats in their natural environment. One of the primary dangers to their survival is the presence of introduced predators, such as foxes and cats, which prey on the quokkas, especially the young. Habitat destruction from human activities, such as development and tourism, also poses a risk to their population. Climate change and the associated rise in temperatures can exacerbate these threats, as quokkas are adapted to relatively stable and mild conditions. Their populations on Rottnest Island are protected, and conservation efforts are in place to ensure their survival, including the management of predators and efforts to safeguard their habitats."
Red Fox,35-50,07-Mar,Reddish-brown,5,Omnivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Wolves, Eagles",48,"North America, Europe, Asia",Least Concern,Canidae,52,48,Solitary,06-Apr,"The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one of the most widely distributed and adaptable mammals in the world, found across a vast range of ecosystems from forests and grasslands to urban areas. Native to Eurasia, it has been introduced to North America, where it thrives in a variety of environments, from rural farmlands to bustling cities. Recognizable by its reddish-orange fur, white underbelly, and bushy tail with a characteristic white tip, the red fox is known for its beauty and agility. It is a member of the Canidae family, closely related to other canids such as wolves, coyotes, and domestic dogs, but it is much smaller, with adults typically weighing between 3 to 6 kilograms (6.5 to 13 pounds).

Red foxes are omnivorous and highly opportunistic feeders, which is a significant factor in their wide-ranging success across different habitats. Their diet consists of a variety of foods, including small mammals like rabbits, rodents, and birds, as well as fruits, berries, insects, and even carrion. They are skilled hunters, often stalking their prey with remarkable stealth and agility. Their sharp hearing enables them to detect the movements of rodents beneath the snow or underbrush. Foxes use a variety of hunting techniques, including pouncing, which involves leaping into the air and landing on prey from above, especially when hunting small mammals.

Socially, red foxes are generally solitary creatures, unlike wolves that live in packs. They are known for being territorial, marking their home ranges with scent markings made from urine, feces, and glands located near their tails. These markings communicate to other foxes about territory boundaries and mating availability. However, foxes will occasionally come together in family groups, particularly during the breeding season or when mothers are raising their young. Mating typically occurs in the winter, with females giving birth to a litter of up to 12 pups, though 4 to 6 is more common. The pups are born blind and helpless but grow quickly, relying on their mother for warmth, food, and protection.

Red foxes are crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) and nocturnal, although they can be active at any time of day, particularly in areas with low human disturbance. Their activity patterns are often influenced by the availability of food and the need to avoid predators, such as larger carnivores and birds of prey. Although adult foxes do not have many natural predators, their young are vulnerable to attacks by owls, hawks, and larger carnivores such as wolves, coyotes, and even domestic dogs. Their intelligence and adaptability also serve as a defense against threats, as they are quick to learn and adapt to changing circumstances.

Red foxes are highly adaptable animals and have successfully thrived in areas heavily influenced by human activity. They are often found in rural and urban environments, where they scavenge in garbage bins, hunt rodents in suburban gardens, or take shelter in abandoned buildings. This adaptability to human-dominated landscapes has made them somewhat of a ""commensal"" species, meaning they benefit from their proximity to human settlements without causing major harm. However, their presence in urban areas can sometimes lead to conflicts with humans, particularly when they become bold in foraging or when they establish dens in places like gardens or under sheds.

One of the red fox’s most notable behaviors is its vocal communication. Foxes produce a wide variety of sounds, including barks, screams, and howls, which are used for communication with other foxes. These vocalizations serve purposes such as marking territory, signaling alarm, and calling to mates. The ""fox scream,"" a high-pitched, eerie sound often heard at night, is a particularly distinctive vocalization and is used by both males and females during the breeding season to attract mates or warn other foxes of their presence."
Red Kangaroo,140-180,18-95,"Brown, Red",Up to 23,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Dingoes, Eagles",56,Australia,Least Concern,Macropodidae,30-34,56,Group-based,1,"The red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) is the largest species of kangaroo and one of Australia’s most iconic animals. Native to the continent, it is found across a wide range of habitats, from arid deserts to grasslands and open woodlands. The red kangaroo is known for its impressive size, powerful hind legs, and distinctive reddish-brown fur, which gives it its name. Adult males, called boomers, can reach up to 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) in length, including their tail, and can weigh as much as 90 kilograms (200 pounds). Females, or does, are smaller and lighter, typically weighing around 35 to 40 kilograms (77 to 88 pounds).

The red kangaroo's powerful hind legs are its most notable physical adaptation, allowing it to travel long distances with remarkable efficiency. Kangaroos are known for their distinctive hopping gait, or ""saltation,"" which is energy-efficient over long distances. The large, muscular hind legs are used for propulsion, while the long, strong tail is employed for balance. Hopping allows red kangaroos to cover vast distances in search of food and water, which is crucial in the dry, often barren regions they inhabit. When traveling at high speed, red kangaroos can reach up to 56 km/h (35 mph), with a single hop covering several meters in one leap.

Red kangaroos are primarily herbivorous and feed on a variety of grasses, shrubs, and leaves. Their diet is adapted to the Australian outback, where food sources can be sparse and unpredictable. They are excellent at conserving water, and their diet helps them extract moisture from the vegetation they consume. During dry periods, red kangaroos can survive for extended periods without drinking water, obtaining the necessary hydration from their food. However, when water sources are available, they will drink to replenish their fluids. Their ability to adapt to harsh, arid conditions makes them one of the most resilient species in Australia.

Socially, red kangaroos are usually solitary or form loose, small groups known as mobs. Mobs are often formed by females and their young, while males are typically solitary except during mating seasons. The size of the mob can vary depending on the availability of resources, with larger groups forming when food and water are abundant. Male red kangaroos are territorial during the breeding season and engage in fighting to establish dominance and gain access to mates. These fights often involve powerful kicks and wrestling using their strong hind legs, and the winner of the fight typically gains the right to mate with the females in the area.

Reproduction in red kangaroos is particularly fascinating due to their unique reproductive system. Female kangaroos have the ability to pause the development of their embryos in a process called embryonic diapause. This allows them to delay the birth of their young until conditions are more favorable, such as when food and water are more plentiful. After mating, the female gives birth to a tiny, underdeveloped joey, which immediately crawls into her pouch to continue developing. The joey stays in the pouch for several months, gradually growing and becoming more independent. Once it outgrows the pouch, it begins to explore the world but continues to suckle from its mother until it is fully weaned, typically around 8 to 12 months of age.

Red kangaroos are nocturnal and crepuscular, which means they are most active during the early morning and late afternoon when the temperatures are cooler. During the heat of the day, they rest in the shade or burrow into the cool earth to avoid overheating. Their large ears help them stay cool, as they can dissipate heat through their blood vessels. Red kangaroos are social animals and often engage in playful behavior, especially the younger kangaroos, which practice hopping and kicking as part of their development."
Red Panda,50-65,06-Mar,Reddish-brown,12,Herbivore,Himalayan Foothills,"Snow Leopards, Martens",0.2-0.4,"China, Nepal, Bhutan, India",Endangered,Ailuridae,112-158,0.2-0.4,Solitary,04-Jan,"The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a small, tree-dwelling mammal native to the mountainous regions of Himalayas and parts of China, Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is known for its distinctive reddish-brown fur, long bushy tail with rings, and striking white markings on its face and ears. The red panda is a member of its own family, Ailuridae, and is not closely related to the giant panda despite its similar name. Its small size, adorable appearance, and elusive nature have made it a beloved animal in the world of wildlife conservation.

Red pandas are about the size of a domestic cat, measuring around 50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 inches) in body length, with an additional tail length of about 28 to 49 cm (11 to 19 inches). They weigh between 3 to 6.2 kg (6.6 to 13.6 lbs). Their fur, which ranges from reddish-brown to orange, is thick and provides excellent insulation against the cold temperatures of their mountainous habitats. The tail is not only long and bushy but also serves as a balance aid while navigating the trees. Their short, rounded ears and sharp, small face further add to their characteristic appearance.

Red pandas are arboreal, spending most of their time in trees, where they feed, rest, and play. They are primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, which means they are most active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk. Their diet is mainly composed of bamboo—a significant part of their nutrition, though they also eat fruits, berries, acorns, leaves, and occasionally small animals like insects, eggs, and birds. Unlike giant pandas, which have a specialized diet of almost exclusively bamboo, red pandas supplement their diet with other foods to meet their nutritional needs. Despite their dependence on bamboo, red pandas are more flexible in their food choices, which allows them to survive in a wider range of habitats.

One of the red panda's most remarkable adaptations is its false thumb, which is actually a modified wrist bone that helps it grasp bamboo stalks and other food. This thumb-like structure gives red pandas a greater ability to manipulate objects, which is crucial for feeding and climbing. The red panda’s ability to climb trees is another important adaptation. It has sharp claws and a flexible ankle joint that allows it to descend trees headfirst, an ability that provides an advantage in evading predators or simply moving between trees to find food.

Reproduction in red pandas typically occurs in the spring, with a gestation period lasting around 4 to 5 months. After birth, the female cares for the kits (the term for baby red pandas), which are born blind and helpless. The kits stay in the safety of their mother's den for several months, during which they grow quickly and develop the skills needed to climb and forage. By the time they are about a year old, the young pandas become independent, though they may stay within the vicinity of their mother's territory for a time. Red pandas typically live up to 8 to 10 years in the wild, though they can live longer in captivity.

Unfortunately, the red panda is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of fewer than 10,000 individuals in the wild. The primary threats to red pandas are habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching for their fur. As forests are cleared for agriculture and development, red panda populations become increasingly isolated in fragmented areas, making it difficult for them to find mates and food. Climate change also poses a threat, as it can alter the availability of bamboo and other food sources in their high-altitude habitats. Additionally, red pandas are sometimes captured and sold illegally in wildlife trade."
Red-Eyed Tree Frog,5.1-7.5,Up to 0.1,"Green, Red",Up to 5,Insectivore,Rainforests,"Snakes, Birds",Not Applicable,Central America,Least Concern,Hylidae,07-May,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 100,"The red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) is one of the most vibrant and visually striking amphibians in the world. Native to the tropical rainforests of Central America, specifically in regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, it is known for its brilliant coloration, which includes bright green skin, blue and yellow markings on its sides, and, most famously, its large, round red eyes. This coloration serves both as camouflage and as a defense mechanism in its jungle habitat, helping it blend into the leaves and branches while hiding from predators. However, the bright red eyes can also serve as a startling display to ward off potential threats.

Red-eyed tree frogs are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their lives in trees and bushes, typically in the lower to middle canopy of tropical rainforests. They are particularly adapted to life in the trees with specialized adhesive pads on their fingers and toes, which allow them to easily climb and cling to smooth, vertical surfaces like leaves and branches. These pads are incredibly effective, enabling the frog to maintain a strong grip even on slippery or wet surfaces, which is essential in the humid rainforest environment where rain is frequent.

Physically, adult red-eyed tree frogs are small, measuring around 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) in body length, with males being slightly smaller than females. Their distinct green coloration helps them blend into the leaves and stems of the plants they inhabit, offering protection from predators. When threatened, however, the frog will often display its bright red eyes and may even flash its brightly colored blue and yellow limbs. This display can startle predators, giving the frog a chance to escape. Despite their vibrant appearance, these frogs are relatively small and rely more on speed and agility to avoid predators than on strength.

Red-eyed tree frogs are nocturnal, meaning they are primarily active at night. During the day, they tend to hide in the foliage or under leaves, staying out of sight of both predators and the sun. This behavior helps them avoid the intense heat of the day and stay hydrated in the humid rainforest environment. At night, they come out to forage for food, which mainly consists of insects such as crickets, moths, flies, and other small arthropods. Their diet is typical for a frog, relying on their quick reflexes to snatch prey with their long, sticky tongues.

Reproduction in red-eyed tree frogs typically occurs during the rainy season when the abundance of water makes breeding easier. Females lay their eggs on the undersides of large, broad leaves that overhang water bodies like ponds, streams, or pools. These eggs are often laid in clusters of dozens or even hundreds. After the female deposits her eggs, the male fertilizes them externally. As the eggs develop, they hatch into tadpoles, which drop into the water below to continue their development. The tadpoles undergo metamorphosis in the water, growing into juvenile frogs before eventually making their way into the trees.

The red-eyed tree frog's bright coloration and its ability to change the way it positions its body (like pulling in its limbs and becoming less visible) make it an excellent example of aposematism, a defense mechanism in which an animal uses warning colors or behaviors to signal its unpalatability or danger. Despite their vibrant hues, red-eyed tree frogs are not venomous or dangerous to humans, but their striking appearance can signal to predators that they are not easy prey. Additionally, their ability to quickly leap from branch to branch, aided by their long legs, allows them to escape danger swiftly."
Rottweiler,56-69,36-60,"Black, Tan",10,Carnivore,Worldwide,"Wolves, Coyotes",35,Worldwide,Not Applicable,Canidae,61-65,32,Pack-based,12-Jun,"The Rottweiler is a large and powerful breed of dog known for its strength, loyalty, and protective instincts. Originally bred in Germany, the Rottweiler's roots trace back to the ancient Roman Empire, where they were used as herding dogs and guard dogs for cattle. The breed's name is derived from the town of Rottweil, a market town in Germany where these dogs were primarily used for herding livestock and pulling carts. Over time, Rottweilers were also employed as guard dogs, police dogs, and even in military and search-and-rescue roles due to their intelligence and ability to work well under pressure.

Rottweilers are muscular, robust, and athletic, with a characteristic black and tan coat that is short and dense. Adult Rottweilers typically stand between 22 to 27 inches (56 to 69 cm) tall at the shoulder, with males weighing anywhere from 95 to 135 pounds (43 to 61 kg) and females typically a little lighter. Their strong, compact bodies are built for endurance and strength, and they are known for their confidence and alertness. The breed’s head is broad with a pronounced brow, and their eyes are dark, showing an intelligent and calm expression. The Rottweiler's large size and intimidating presence make them excellent guard dogs, but their temperament is often described as calm and steady when properly trained and socialized.

Rottweilers are highly intelligent and trainable, but they require an experienced owner who can provide firm, consistent training and socialization from an early age. While they can be friendly and affectionate with their families, they tend to be reserved and even aloof around strangers. This breed is naturally protective and can become wary or suspicious of unfamiliar people, making them effective guardians of property and loved ones. Their protective nature is one of their most valued traits, but without proper guidance, they may become overly protective or aggressive. Early socialization with other dogs, animals, and people is important to ensure that Rottweilers grow up to be well-balanced adults.

Though often used as guard dogs, Rottweilers are affectionate and loyal companions to their families. They form strong bonds with their owners and are often described as gentle giants when treated with respect. They are known to be good with children, especially if raised with them, and are often protective of family members. Despite their imposing appearance, Rottweilers can be very playful, loving, and affectionate towards those they trust. They also tend to be quite energetic and playful, enjoying activities such as fetch, hiking, and running, which helps to keep them mentally and physically stimulated.

Rottweilers are generally healthy dogs, but they can be prone to certain health conditions, including hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, heart problems, and certain types of cancer. Regular vet check-ups, a balanced diet, and ample exercise are key to ensuring a long, healthy life. Due to their large size, Rottweilers may have a shorter lifespan compared to smaller breeds, typically living between 8 to 10 years. It's also important to note that Rottweilers require a high level of physical activity and mental stimulation to avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behavior if left unengaged."
Saola,Up to 90,Up to 100,"Brown, White",Up to 21,Herbivore,Forests,"Tigers, Leopards",26,"Vietnam, Laos",Critically Endangered,Bovidae,240,26,Solitary,1,"The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), often referred to as the ""Asian unicorn,"" is an elusive and critically endangered species native to the dense forests along the Annamite Mountains on the border of Vietnam and Laos. First discovered by scientists in 1992, the saola's existence was a remarkable find, as it represented one of the most significant mammalian discoveries of the 20th century. Despite its unicorn moniker, the saola is a type of bovid, closely related to cattle, goats, and antelopes, but it is the only member of its genus, Pseudoryx. Its rarity and the difficulty of observing it in the wild have added to its mystique and conservation importance.

Physically, the saola is a medium-sized animal, resembling an antelope, with a height at the shoulder of about 80–90 cm (31–35 inches) and weighing between 80–100 kg (176–220 pounds). It is characterized by its sleek, chocolate-brown coat with a white patch on its face, white markings along its cheeks, and a pair of long, straight horns that can grow up to 50 cm (20 inches) in both males and females. These horns, along with its markings, give the saola its distinct and striking appearance. The name ""saola"" means ""spindle horns"" in the local Lao language, a fitting description of its elegant and symmetrical horns.

The saola inhabits the dense evergreen forests and river valleys of its mountainous range, where it thrives in wet, tropical environments. It is highly adapted to these remote and rugged habitats, often preferring areas with abundant vegetation near water sources. Saolas are believed to be shy and solitary animals, although they have occasionally been observed in pairs or small groups. Their elusive behavior and remote habitat make them extremely difficult to study, and much about their behavior, diet, and reproduction remains a mystery. Based on limited observations, saolas are thought to be herbivorous, feeding on a diet of leaves, grasses, and shrubs.

The saola's population is critically endangered, with estimates suggesting fewer than 100 individuals remaining in the wild, though an exact count is unknown due to its elusive nature. The primary threats to the saola are habitat loss and hunting. Widespread deforestation for agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development has fragmented the forests of the Annamite Mountains, reducing the saola's habitat and isolating populations. Additionally, although the saola is not directly targeted by hunters, it often falls victim to indiscriminate snaring, a common practice in the region for catching other wildlife.

Conservation efforts for the saola have gained international attention, with organizations like the Saola Working Group (SWG) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) focusing on protecting its habitat and reducing hunting pressures. Key strategies include working with local communities to reduce snaring, establishing protected areas, and conducting research to better understand the species. In 2010, the Saola Nature Reserves were established in Vietnam to safeguard its habitat, but the animal remains critically endangered and elusive."
Secretary Bird,100-150,2.3-4.5,"Black, Grey",15,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Savannas","Snakes, Lizards",24,Africa,Least Concern,Sagittariidae,42-46,32,Solitary,2,"The secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) is a unique and striking bird of prey native to the grasslands, savannas, and open plains of sub-Saharan Africa. Distinguished by its long legs, crane-like stature, and bold crest of black feathers at the back of its head, the secretary bird is a raptor unlike any other. Its name is thought to originate from the resemblance of its head feathers to quill pens tucked behind the ear, reminiscent of 19th-century clerks or secretaries. This bird combines the hunting skills of a bird of prey with the terrestrial agility of a ground predator, making it a fascinating subject of study.

Standing at an impressive height of 1.2 to 1.4 meters (4 to 4.5 feet), the secretary bird is one of the tallest birds of prey. Its wingspan can reach up to 2 meters (6.6 feet), and it typically weighs between 3.5 and 4.5 kilograms (7.7 to 10 pounds). It has a distinctive appearance, with a sleek gray body, long bare legs covered with tough scales for protection, and a bright orange or yellow face. Its head features an expressive crest of long black feathers that add to its dramatic look. Unlike other raptors that soar through the skies, the secretary bird is primarily terrestrial, often walking or running across the ground in search of prey.

The secretary bird is a carnivorous predator known for its unique hunting technique. Unlike most raptors, it hunts on foot, stalking prey through grasslands with remarkable speed and precision. Its diet includes a wide variety of animals, such as insects, rodents, snakes, lizards, and small birds. It is especially famous for its ability to hunt and kill snakes, including venomous species like cobras and adders. The bird uses its powerful legs to deliver rapid, precise stomps, often killing its prey with a single blow. This hunting style is not only effective but also minimizes the bird’s risk of injury from dangerous prey.

Secretary birds are monogamous and highly territorial, with pairs defending large home ranges that can span several square kilometers. They build large nests, often located atop acacia trees or other elevated spots, using sticks and grass. The nests can grow quite large over time, as the birds reuse and add to them each breeding season. Both parents share the responsibilities of incubating the eggs, which usually number between one and three, and feeding the chicks. After hatching, the young birds are cared for until they are strong enough to hunt on their own, typically leaving the nest after about 60 to 80 days.

The secretary bird is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with populations declining due to habitat loss, human encroachment, and agricultural expansion. The conversion of grasslands into farmland, as well as the overuse of pesticides, poses significant threats to the bird’s prey base and nesting areas. Additionally, human activity, including road traffic and illegal hunting, further endangers these majestic birds. Despite these challenges, the secretary bird is a protected species in many African countries, with conservation efforts focusing on preserving its habitat and raising awareness about its ecological importance."
Serval,54-62,18-Aug,"Yellowish-Tan, Black",12,Carnivore,"Grasslands, Wetlands","Leopards, Hyenas",44,Africa,Least Concern,Felidae,54-72,44,Solitary,1,"The serval (Leptailurus serval) is a slender and elegant wild cat native to the grasslands, savannas, and wetlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Known for its long legs, oversized ears, and spotted coat, the serval is an efficient and highly specialized predator. Its name originates from the Portuguese word lobo-cerval, meaning ""lynx-like wolf,"" though the serval is more closely related to other African small cats than to the lynx. With its unique appearance and hunting techniques, the serval is a fascinating species that plays an important role in its ecosystem.

Physically, the serval is built for agility and stealth. It has a long, slender body, a small head with large, round ears, and the longest legs relative to body size of any cat. These adaptations allow it to navigate tall grasses with ease and detect prey even from a distance. Adult servals typically stand about 54–66 cm (21–26 inches) tall at the shoulder, weigh between 9–18 kg (20–40 pounds), and have a body length of about 85–112 cm (33–44 inches), including a short tail. Their coat is a striking combination of yellowish-gold fur adorned with black spots and stripes, which provides excellent camouflage in their natural habitats.

The serval is an exceptional hunter, with a success rate far higher than most other wild cats. Its diet consists primarily of small mammals such as rodents, but it also preys on birds, reptiles, frogs, fish, and insects. Its large ears are highly sensitive and allow the serval to locate prey through sound, even when it is hidden beneath the ground or in dense vegetation. Once it detects its prey, the serval uses its long legs to leap high into the air or pounce with remarkable precision. Its ability to jump up to 3 meters (10 feet) vertically makes it adept at catching birds in mid-flight, further showcasing its extraordinary hunting skills.

The serval is a solitary and territorial animal, with individuals marking their ranges using scent markings, urine spraying, and vocalizations. Males tend to have larger territories than females, which often overlap with those of potential mates. While generally solitary, servals come together for mating, after which the female is solely responsible for raising the young. After a gestation period of about two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a secluded den. The kittens stay with their mother for about a year, learning hunting skills before becoming independent.

Servals are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of habitats, but they prefer areas with access to water and tall vegetation for cover. Despite their adaptability, the species faces threats from habitat destruction, particularly the conversion of wetlands and grasslands into agricultural land. Additionally, servals are sometimes hunted for their beautiful pelts or captured for the exotic pet trade, further endangering wild populations. However, they are currently listed as Least Concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, thanks to their wide distribution and stable populations in protected areas."
Shoebill,110-140,06-Apr,Grayish-brown,30-35,Carnivore,"Swamps, Marshes","Crocodiles, Snakes",14-16,Tropical Central Tropical Africa,Vulnerable,Balaenicipitidae,30-35,14-16,Solitary,03-Jan,"The shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) is a large, prehistoric-looking bird that inhabits the wetlands of tropical East Africa. Named for its massive, shoe-shaped bill, the shoebill is a striking and enigmatic species, known for its slow, deliberate movements and statuesque demeanor. It is the sole member of the genus Balaeniceps and is classified in the family Balaenicipitidae, making it a unique species with no close relatives. Found in countries such as South Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and parts of the Congo Basin, the shoebill thrives in swampy habitats rich in vegetation and aquatic life.

Physically, the shoebill is an impressive bird, standing at a height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) with a wingspan of up to 2.5 meters (8 feet). It typically weighs between 4 and 7 kilograms (8.8 to 15.4 pounds). Its most distinctive feature is its large, broad bill, which measures about 24 cm (9.5 inches) long and is equipped with sharp edges and a hook-like tip. The bill's design makes it highly effective for catching and holding slippery prey. The shoebill’s plumage is predominantly gray, and its legs are long and strong, adapted for wading through dense marshes. Its large, expressive yellow eyes contribute to its piercing and slightly intimidating appearance.

The shoebill is a carnivorous bird, feeding primarily on large aquatic prey such as lungfish, tilapia, eels, and even small reptiles and amphibians, including baby crocodiles and snakes. Its hunting technique is stealthy and efficient: the bird remains motionless for long periods, patiently waiting for prey to come within striking range. Once an opportunity arises, the shoebill launches a swift and powerful strike with its bill, often submerging its head underwater to capture its target. This ambush hunting style, coupled with its specialized bill, makes it an apex predator in its wetland habitat.

Shoebills are solitary and territorial, typically defending a home range that provides adequate food and nesting sites. During the breeding season, pairs build large nests from reeds and other vegetation, usually situated on floating platforms in the swamp. The female lays one to three eggs, but in most cases, only one chick survives due to a phenomenon called siblicide, where the stronger chick outcompetes or even kills its sibling for food. Both parents are involved in incubation and feeding, bringing regurgitated prey to the chick. Shoebill chicks take several months to fledge and require extended parental care before becoming independent.

The shoebill is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of fewer than 10,000 individuals. Its primary threats include habitat destruction, particularly the draining of wetlands for agriculture and development, and poaching. Shoebills are also sought after for the exotic pet trade and face disturbance from eco-tourism in some areas. Despite these challenges, conservation efforts are underway, focusing on protecting wetland habitats and raising awareness about the importance of this unique species."
Shortfin Mako Shark,Up to 394,Up to 800,Metallic Blue,28-35,Carnivore,Oceans,Larger Sharks,45,Worldwide,Vulnerable,Lamnidae,20-24,45,Solitary,1,"The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a highly efficient and powerful predator, renowned for being the fastest shark species in the world. Found in temperate and tropical oceans globally, this shark belongs to the family Lamnidae, which includes other swift species like the great white shark. With its streamlined body, remarkable speed, and sharp teeth, the shortfin mako is an apex predator and a key player in marine ecosystems.

Physically, the shortfin mako is striking in appearance. It typically measures between 3 and 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) in length, with some individuals reaching up to 4.5 meters (15 feet). It can weigh anywhere from 130 to 300 kilograms (290 to 660 pounds), with females generally larger than males. Its sleek, torpedo-shaped body is perfectly adapted for speed, allowing it to reach bursts of up to 74 km/h (46 mph). The shark has a metallic blue dorsal side that provides camouflage in open water and a white ventral side that reduces visibility from below. Its large, conical snout and sharp, triangular teeth make it an efficient hunter of fast-moving prey.

The shortfin mako is a carnivore, preying primarily on bony fish such as tuna, mackerel, and swordfish, as well as cephalopods like squid. It uses its incredible speed and agility to chase down prey in open water, often leaping out of the water during hunting or while hooked by fishing gear. With its highly developed sensory organs, including an acute sense of smell and the ability to detect the electrical signals of prey, the shortfin mako is a master of its environment. Its metabolism is also remarkably efficient, enabling it to maintain warm muscles for sustained bursts of speed, a trait shared with other members of the Lamnidae family.

Reproduction in shortfin mako sharks is ovoviviparous, meaning that eggs hatch inside the female's body, and live young are born. Litters typically consist of 8 to 12 pups, which are born fully developed and independent at a length of about 70 cm (2.3 feet). Mako sharks grow slowly, with females maturing at around 18 years and males at about 8 years, making them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. They have a long lifespan, with some individuals living up to 30 years or more.

The shortfin mako faces significant conservation challenges and is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Overfishing, both targeted and as bycatch, is the primary threat to its population. The shark is highly prized for its meat, fins, and as a game fish, leading to significant population declines. Its slow growth and low reproductive rate further hinder its ability to recover from overexploitation. Additionally, habitat degradation and the effects of climate change, including shifts in ocean temperature and prey availability, pose additional threats."
Siberian Husky,50-60,16-27,Various,14,Carnivore,Cold Regions,"Wolves, Bears",50-65,"Siberia, Alaska",Not Applicable,Canidae,60-63,48,Pack-based,06-Apr,"The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized, highly energetic working dog known for its striking appearance, friendly demeanor, and exceptional endurance. Originally bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia, this breed was developed to pull sleds over long distances in harsh Arctic conditions. Today, the Siberian Husky is cherished as both a working dog and a loving companion, valued for its intelligence, loyalty, and striking beauty.

Physically, the Siberian Husky is a compact and athletic dog, weighing between 35 to 60 pounds (16 to 27 kg) and standing about 20 to 24 inches (51 to 61 cm) at the shoulder. Its thick, double-layered coat, which comes in a variety of colors and markings, provides excellent insulation against extreme cold. Common coat colors include black, gray, red, and pure white, often accented by distinct facial masks or markings. One of the breed’s most notable features is its piercing, almond-shaped eyes, which can be brown, blue, or even bi-colored. Its erect, triangular ears and bushy tail further contribute to its wolf-like appearance.

The Siberian Husky is renowned for its high energy levels and need for physical activity. This breed thrives in active environments and requires daily exercise to stay healthy and mentally stimulated. Huskies are skilled runners and pullers, making them well-suited for dog sledding, skijoring, and other endurance sports. Their history as pack animals contributes to their cooperative nature, but it also means they can be mischievous if not properly trained or exercised. Without adequate activity, Huskies may become bored, leading to behaviors like digging or escaping.

Social and outgoing, Siberian Huskies are known for their friendly and gentle temperament. They are generally good with children and other dogs, making them excellent family pets. However, their strong prey drive means they may not be the best choice for households with small animals like cats or rabbits. Huskies are independent thinkers, and while they are intelligent, they can also be stubborn. Positive reinforcement training and consistent boundaries are essential for managing their spirited nature.

One of the breed’s unique traits is its vocality. Huskies are not typically aggressive barkers, but they are known for their expressive howls and “talking.” This communicative nature, paired with their friendly disposition, makes them charming companions but not ideal guard dogs, as they tend to be welcoming to strangers.

Caring for a Siberian Husky requires dedication. Their dense coat sheds heavily twice a year during seasonal transitions, requiring regular grooming to manage the shedding. They are naturally clean dogs with minimal odor, but they benefit from occasional baths and routine care for their nails, teeth, and ears. Huskies are also known for their resilience in cold climates but may struggle in hot or humid environments, requiring proper cooling and hydration in such conditions.

While generally healthy, Siberian Huskies are prone to certain genetic health issues, including hip dysplasia, eye disorders like cataracts, and thyroid conditions. Responsible breeders conduct health screenings to minimize these risks. With proper care and regular veterinary check-ups, Siberian Huskies can live long, healthy lives, often reaching 12 to 14 years of age."
Sloth,50-60,3.6-9,"Brown, Gray",16,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Jaguars, Harpy Eagles",0.03-0.24,Central and South America,Least Concern,Bradypodidae,120-180,0.03-0.24,Solitary,1,"Sloths are a Neotropical group of xenarthran mammals constituting the suborder Folivora, including the extant arboreal tree sloths and extinct terrestrial ground sloths. Noted for their slowness of movement, tree sloths spend most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America. Sloths are considered to be most closely related to anteaters, together making up the xenarthran order Pilosa.

There are six extant sloth species in two genera – Bradypus (three-toed sloths) and Choloepus (two-toed sloths). Despite this traditional naming, all sloths have three toes on each rear limb – although two-toed sloths have only two digits on each forelimb. The two groups of sloths are from different, distantly related families, and are thought to have evolved their morphology via parallel evolution from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the extant species, many species of ground sloths ranging up to the size of elephants (like Megatherium) inhabited both North and South America during the Pleistocene Epoch. However, they became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event around 12,000 years ago, along with most large animals across the Americas. The extinction correlates in time with the arrival of humans, but climate change has also been suggested to have contributed. Members of an endemic radiation of Caribbean sloths also formerly lived in the Greater Antilles but became extinct after humans settled the archipelago in the mid-Holocene, around 6,000 years ago.

Sloths are so named because of their very low metabolism and deliberate movements. Sloth, related to slow, literally means ""laziness"", and their common names in several other languages (e.g. German: Faultier, French: paresseux, Spanish: perezoso, Romanian: leneș, Finnish: laiskiainen) also mean ""lazy"" or similar. Their slowness permits their low-energy diet of leaves and avoids detection by predatory hawks and cats that hunt by sight. Sloths are almost helpless on the ground but are able to swim. The shaggy coat has grooved hair that is host to symbiotic green algae which camouflage the animal in the trees and provide it nutrients. The algae also nourish sloth moths, some species of which exist solely on sloths.
Physically, sloths are characterized by long limbs, curved claws, and a specialized shoulder joint that allows them to hang effortlessly from tree branches. Their fur hosts a unique ecosystem, including algae that give their coat a greenish tint, providing effective camouflage in the forest canopy. The algae, along with moths and other organisms living in their fur, form a symbiotic relationship with the sloth, benefiting both the mammal and its micro-ecosystem.

Despite their reputation for being slow and clumsy on the ground, sloths are surprisingly adept swimmers, using their long arms to move efficiently through water. This skill is especially useful during flooding in their rainforest habitats. Sloths also have an unusual biological trait: they descend from trees only about once a week to defecate, a behavior whose exact purpose is still debated but may be linked to communication or the health of their fur ecosystem.

Sloths play a vital role in their environment, acting as a host for various organisms and contributing to the nutrient cycle in the rainforest. Their slow lifestyle, while making them vulnerable to human threats such as deforestation and illegal wildlife trade, highlights the importance of conserving their habitats to maintain ecological balance. Sloths are not just an emblem of patience and calm but also a testament to the incredible diversity and adaptability of life in the natural world."
Slow Loris,20-38,0.3-1.6,Yellowish-Brown,20-24,Omnivore,Forests,"Birds, Snakes",Not Applicable,Southeast Asia,Vulnerable,Lorisidae,23-26,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 10,"Slow lorises are a group of several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates that make up the genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and nearby areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south.

Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their torso is long and flexible, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique among the primates. The toxin is obtained by licking a sweat gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by mixing with saliva. Their toxic bite, once thought to be primarily a deterrent to predators, has been discovered to be primarily used in disputes within the species.

The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen, but may be augmented by secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals. Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately, making little or no noise, and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. Their only documented predators—apart from humans—include snakes, changeable hawk-eagles and orangutans, although cats, viverrids and sun bears are suspected. Little is known about their social structure, but they are known to communicate by scent marking. Males are highly territorial. Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent. They are omnivores, eating small animals, fruit, tree gum, and other vegetation.

Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either ""Vulnerable"" or ""Endangered"" on the IUCN Red List. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated, but they arise from (and further reduce the ranks of) what was thought to be a single ""vulnerable"" species. All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same, if not a higher-risk, conservation status. All slow lorises are threatened by the wildlife trade and habitat loss. Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented, making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments; unsustainable demand from the exotic pet trade and from traditional medicine has been the greatest cause for their decline.

Snow Leopard,50-70,22-75,"Grayish-yellow, Black",15,Carnivore,"Mountains, Steppes","Humans, Wolves",40-60,Central and South Asia,Vulnerable,Felidae,90-100,40-60,Solitary,05-Jan,"The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is a magnificent and elusive big cat that inhabits the rugged mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. Known as the ""ghost of the mountains"" for its stealth and secretive nature, this species is perfectly adapted to life in some of the harshest environments on Earth. Revered in local cultures and recognized globally as a symbol of conservation, the snow leopard is both a top predator and a critical indicator of ecosystem health in its range.

Physically, snow leopards are uniquely adapted for survival in high-altitude environments, typically found at elevations between 3,000 to 5,000 meters (10,000 to 16,500 feet). They have a thick, soft coat that ranges from smoky gray to creamy white, adorned with dark rosettes and spots that provide excellent camouflage against rocky terrain. Their long, bushy tail, which can be as long as their body, helps with balance on precarious slopes and serves as a wrap-around blanket to retain warmth during extreme cold. Snow leopards are relatively small for big cats, measuring about 90 to 115 cm (3 to 4 feet) in body length, with males weighing between 45 to 55 kg (99 to 121 lbs) and females slightly smaller.

Snow leopards are carnivores, preying on a variety of animals, including blue sheep (bharal), ibex, marmots, and occasionally livestock in regions where their natural prey is scarce. They are ambush predators, relying on their incredible agility and powerful hind legs to leap as far as 15 meters (50 feet) in pursuit of prey. Their solitary nature and wide-ranging territories, which can span hundreds of square kilometers, are essential for securing enough food in their sparse, resource-limited habitats.

Behaviorally, snow leopards are solitary except during the mating season or when females are raising cubs. Mating occurs in late winter, and after a gestation period of about 90 to 100 days, females give birth to a litter of 1 to 5 cubs in a sheltered den. The cubs stay with their mother for about two years, learning essential survival skills before venturing out on their own. Snow leopards communicate through vocalizations like growls and mews, scent marking, and scraping the ground to define their territory.

Despite their formidable adaptations, snow leopards face numerous threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. The conversion of their natural habitat for agriculture and infrastructure development reduces prey availability and forces them closer to human settlements, where they may prey on livestock. This often results in retaliatory killings by herders. Snow leopards are also hunted for their luxurious fur and bones, which are used in traditional medicine.

Conservation efforts for snow leopards are underway through international and local initiatives. The Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (GSLEP) unites 12 range countries in protecting this iconic species and its habitat. Measures such as establishing protected areas, mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and promoting ecotourism have contributed to some population stability. Although listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the global population is estimated at 4,000 to 6,500 individuals, with ongoing challenges requiring continued attention."
Snowy Owl,52-71,1.6-3.3,White,15,Carnivore,"Arctic, North America","Foxes, Wolves",80,"Arctic, North America",Least Concern,Strigidae,32-34,80,Solitary,11-Mar,"The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl, is a large, white owl of the true owl family. Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra. It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls. One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage. Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown. Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls.

Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime. The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding efforts and global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling lemmings, but in the non-breeding season, and occasionally during breeding, the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available prey – most often other small mammals and northerly water birds, as well as, opportunistically, carrion. Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra. The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered. Despite the short Arctic summer, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn.

The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable. A largely migratory bird, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably irrupting to the south in large numbers. Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in-depth knowledge historically about the snowy owl's status. However, recent data suggests the species is declining precipitously. Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals, recent data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less. While the causes are not well understood, numerous, complex environmental factors often correlated with global warming are probably at the forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl's existence.

Spectacled Bear,120-200,35-77,"Black, Tan",25,Omnivore,Forests,"Jaguars, Pumas",45,South America,Vulnerable,Ursidae,200-294,45,Solitary,1,"The spectacled bear, also known as the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus), is the only bear species native to South America. It is primarily found in the Andean mountain range, spanning across countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile. Spectacled bears are named for the unique markings around their eyes, which often resemble spectacles or glasses. These markings are typically light-colored fur, which contrasts with their otherwise dark brown or black fur. Each bear has distinct facial patterns, and no two individuals have the same markings, making them easily recognizable.

As the largest land mammal in South America, the spectacled bear can grow to be about 5 to 6 feet long and weigh between 200 to 400 pounds. Their physical characteristics include a large, stocky body with long, strong claws suited for climbing. Spectacled bears are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees, especially when they are foraging for food. Their strong claws help them grasp tree trunks and climb with ease, a trait that is vital for escaping predators and finding food in the dense Andean forests.

Spectacled bears are primarily herbivorous, with a diet that consists mostly of fruits, leaves, bamboo, and flowers. However, they are also known to eat insects and small animals on occasion. Their preferred food sources include the fruit of palm trees, and they will occasionally raid agricultural crops, such as corn or sugarcane, which brings them into conflict with local human populations. Despite being mostly herbivores, spectacled bears have the digestive system of carnivores, which means their stomachs are designed to process a wide variety of foods.

In terms of behavior, spectacled bears are solitary animals. They live alone and tend to avoid interaction with others of their species, except during mating season or when mothers are caring for their cubs. Their solitary nature is reflected in their large home ranges, which can cover tens of square miles, depending on the availability of food and the landscape of the region. Spectacled bears are nocturnal or crepuscular, meaning they are most active during the early morning or evening hours, which helps them avoid the heat of the day.

The spectacled bear is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to a combination of habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. As forests are cleared for agriculture, urbanization, and logging, the bear's natural habitat is rapidly diminishing. This loss of habitat, coupled with fragmentation of the landscape, makes it difficult for spectacled bears to find enough food or mates. Additionally, they are sometimes hunted for their fur or killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Their status as a vulnerable species has led to efforts to protect their habitats, including the establishment of wildlife reserves and national parks across the Andes."
Sperm Whale,Up to 2056,Up to 57000,Gray,50-60,Carnivore,Oceans,Orcas,60,Worldwide,Vulnerable,Physeteridae,50-60,60,Solitary,1,"The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is one of the most fascinating and iconic marine mammals, known for its massive size and distinctively large, square-shaped head. As the largest toothed whale, sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet long and weigh as much as 45 tons, with males generally being larger than females. One of their most distinguishing features is their head, which can account for up to a third of their total body length. The head contains the spermaceti organ, a large, oil-filled cavity believed to aid in buoyancy control, echolocation, and possibly communication. The spermaceti oil also gave the whale its name, as it was once mistakenly thought to be sperm due to its milky appearance.

Sperm whales are found in oceans worldwide, though they prefer deep, offshore waters where they can dive to great depths in search of food. They are renowned for their ability to dive to depths of over 10,000 feet, which makes them the deepest-diving mammals. Their primary diet consists of large squid, including the elusive giant squid, and they have specialized adaptations to hunt in the dark, deep waters where light does not penetrate. Sperm whales use echolocation—a form of biosonar—to locate prey. By emitting clicks and listening for the returning echoes, they can pinpoint the location, size, and shape of objects in the dark depths.

Sperm whales are highly social animals, often found in groups called ""pods"" that are usually made up of females and their calves. Male sperm whales, however, tend to live more solitary lives after reaching maturity. These whales are known for their complex social structures, and mothers play a key role in raising their calves, teaching them how to hunt and navigate the ocean. Calves typically stay with their mothers for several years before becoming more independent. While sperm whale pods are generally stable, males often roam alone or in small bachelor groups, especially as they age and become larger.

In addition to their physical and social traits, sperm whales are also known for their vocalizations, which are some of the loudest in the animal kingdom. They produce a range of sounds, including clicks and squawks, used for communication, navigation, and hunting. The intensity of their vocalizations can reach up to 230 decibels, which is louder than a jet engine. These vocalizations, particularly the clicks, can be used to communicate over long distances in the vast, open ocean.

Sperm whales have a relatively long lifespan, with some individuals living over 70 years. They have few natural predators, though orcas have been known to target younger or sick individuals. Historically, sperm whales were heavily hunted for their oil, which was prized for use in lamps, lubricants, and candles, and their whalebone was used in various products. This hunting, combined with habitat disturbances and pollution, led to a significant decline in their population. Today, sperm whales are protected under international law, and their populations are recovering, though they still face threats from ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and ocean noise pollution."
Spider Monkey,35-64,09-Jun,"Brown, Black",25-36,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Jaguars, Pumas",45,Central and South America,Vulnerable,Atelidae,110-160,45,Group-based,1,"The spider monkey, a member of the Ateles genus, is a type of New World monkey found in the tropical forests of Central and South America. Known for their long, spindly limbs and prehensile tail, spider monkeys are large, agile primates that are specially adapted to life in the trees. Their tail, which is highly flexible and can grasp objects like a fifth limb, plays a crucial role in their movement and foraging. Spider monkeys are arboreal, spending almost their entire lives in the forest canopy, where they use their long arms and tail to swing from branch to branch in a movement known as brachiation.

Spider monkeys are primarily frugivores, meaning they feed mostly on fruit, although their diet also includes leaves, flowers, seeds, and occasionally insects. Their strong jaws and large molars are adapted for grinding and chewing tough, fibrous food. They are particularly important in their ecosystems as seed dispersers, helping to maintain the health and diversity of the forests in which they live. They feed on a wide variety of fruits, including those that are difficult for other animals to access, and by dispersing seeds, they help promote forest regeneration.

Socially, spider monkeys live in large, fluid groups, known as troops, which can range from 10 to 20 individuals, though they are often seen in smaller subgroups. The groups are usually composed of both males and females, with females typically playing a central role in social dynamics. Spider monkeys are matrilineal, meaning that family ties and group leadership are often passed down through the females. Males tend to leave the group when they reach adulthood and may join different troops throughout their lives. Social interactions are important for bonding, and spider monkeys communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including screams, grunts, and howls, which help coordinate group movements or warn of potential threats.

Reproduction in spider monkeys is slow, with females giving birth to a single infant every two to four years. The young are carried by their mothers for an extended period, and infants typically stay with their mothers for several years to learn survival skills. This long dependency period means that spider monkeys have low reproductive rates, which makes them particularly vulnerable to environmental threats. The bond between mother and infant is strong, and the infant relies on the mother for both nourishment and protection during its early stages of life.

Spider monkeys face numerous threats, primarily due to habitat destruction caused by deforestation, logging, and agricultural expansion in Central and South America. As forests are cleared, the monkeys' living space shrinks, and their access to food sources becomes more limited. Additionally, they are hunted for bushmeat, and their forest habitat is increasingly fragmented, making it difficult for groups to remain cohesive. Climate change also poses a threat by altering the forests they rely on for food. As a result, many species of spider monkeys, particularly the black spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) and the mantled howler monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), are classified as vulnerable or endangered by conservation organizations.

Conservation efforts for spider monkeys focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching initiatives, and raising awareness about the importance of preserving these primates. Some regions have established protected areas and wildlife corridors to help preserve their habitats, while local communities are encouraged to engage in sustainable practices to reduce the negative impact of deforestation. Education programs are also crucial in fostering a greater understanding of the ecological role of spider monkeys and the need to protect their rainforest environments."
Spotted Hyena,70-92,44-64,Yellowish-brown,25,"Carnivore, Scavenger","Grasslands, Savannahs","Lions, Leopards",56-64,Sub-Saharan Africa,Least Concern,Hyaenidae,90-110,56,Group-based,04-Jan,"The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is one of the most well-known and widespread species of hyena found across sub-Saharan Africa. It is recognized for its unique appearance, with a sturdy, muscular body, long legs, and a short, dense coat, typically covered in spots that vary in size and density. The coat is usually a pale yellowish or brownish color with dark spots that help the hyena blend into its environment, especially in the grassy savannas and open woodlands where it predominantly resides. Spotted hyenas are medium to large carnivores, with adults weighing between 120 to 190 pounds, making them larger than other hyena species.

Spotted hyenas are known for their complex social structure, which is one of the most intricate among mammals. They live in large, matriarchal groups called clans, which can consist of anywhere from 5 to 80 individuals. The clan is led by a dominant female, and all members of the clan, both males and females, follow a strict hierarchy that is based on age and status. Female spotted hyenas are larger and more dominant than males, a characteristic that sets them apart from most other carnivores, where males are typically the dominant sex. Within the clan, cooperation is key, and members work together to hunt, defend territory, and raise offspring.

Spotted hyenas are opportunistic feeders and are highly skilled hunters, although they are also known to scavenge from other predators, such as lions and wild dogs. They hunt in teams, using their strong jaws and endurance to chase down prey, often targeting larger herbivores like wildebeest, zebras, and antelope. Their hunting strategy relies on persistence rather than speed, as they can run at moderate speeds for several miles. They are also adept at taking advantage of carcasses left by other predators, often driving off smaller scavengers or competing predators. Their powerful bite can crush bones, which is an adaptation that allows them to access the nutrient-rich marrow inside.

The vocalizations of the spotted hyena are another hallmark of its behavior. They are known for their ""laugh,"" a high-pitched, cackling sound that has been misinterpreted as a sign of amusement but actually serves as a form of communication. The ""laugh"" is used to indicate excitement, submission, or distress and is often heard when hyenas are communicating during a hunt or when interacting with other clan members. In addition to the laugh, spotted hyenas also make growls, howls, and grunts to communicate with one another, especially when it comes to claiming territory or warning off intruders.

Reproduction in spotted hyenas is unique in that the species exhibits a high level of maternal care. Female hyenas give birth to one or two cubs after a gestation period of about 110 days. The cubs are born in a den, which is usually located in a secluded area within the clan's territory. Hyena cubs are born with their eyes open and are immediately able to walk, which is an advantage in the wild. However, the first few months of life can be challenging, as cubs must compete for food and status within the clan. Cubs are highly dependent on their mothers for nourishment, and the social hierarchy within the clan often determines the cubs' survival chances. The most dominant cubs tend to survive better due to their access to food and protection."
Squirrel Monkey,25-35,0.5-1,"Yellowish-Orange, Black",Up to 20,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Snakes, Hawks",30,Central and South America,Least Concern,Cebidae,15-20,30,Group-based,40-50,"The squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) is a small, agile primate native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, primarily found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. As its name suggests, the squirrel monkey's appearance is reminiscent of a squirrel, with its small size, quick movements, and a long tail that aids in balance. These monkeys typically weigh around 15 to 19 ounces, with a body length of about 16 to 24 inches, while their tail can reach 24 to 30 inches long. Their fur is usually a combination of golden-yellow and black, with a lighter-colored face and distinctive white markings around their eyes, giving them a somewhat expressive, curious appearance.

Squirrel monkeys are highly social animals and live in large troops that can range from 20 to 500 individuals, depending on the habitat and food availability. The social structure of a squirrel monkey troop is complex, with strong bonds between individuals. Troops are usually led by a dominant male, but social interactions within the group are cooperative, and individuals engage in grooming, playing, and vocalizing to maintain group cohesion. Communication among squirrel monkeys is highly vocal, with a wide range of sounds used for different purposes, such as alerting others to the presence of predators or coordinating group movements.

Diet-wise, squirrel monkeys are primarily omnivorous, with a diet that consists of fruits, seeds, flowers, insects, and small vertebrates. They are opportunistic feeders and will often forage in the upper canopy of the rainforest, using their excellent vision and dexterous hands to grasp and manipulate objects. Their diet is diverse and seasonal, meaning that they rely on their group's social structure to find and share food sources efficiently. They often forage in groups, and the troops’ movements help ensure that food sources are found and accessed more easily.

One of the most remarkable features of squirrel monkeys is their incredible agility. Their long, prehensile tails and limber limbs allow them to navigate through the treetops with exceptional speed and precision. This agility is an important adaptation for avoiding predators and for reaching food in the canopy. Squirrel monkeys are known for their ability to leap from tree to tree, using their tails for balance and support. Their small size and agility also allow them to occupy ecological niches that larger primates may not be able to access.

In terms of reproduction, female squirrel monkeys give birth to a single infant after a gestation period of about five months. The infant is born fully dependent on its mother, and for the first few months of life, it will cling to her belly or back for safety and transportation. The mother plays a key role in the infant’s development, providing both nourishment and protection. Young squirrel monkeys start to explore their surroundings at a young age, and by the time they are a few months old, they begin to learn how to forage and climb, eventually becoming fully integrated into the group.

Despite their adaptability and social nature, squirrel monkeys face a number of threats. Habitat destruction, primarily due to deforestation, poses a significant risk to their populations, as their rainforest habitats are cleared for agriculture, logging, and urbanization. Additionally, squirrel monkeys are sometimes hunted for their meat or captured for the illegal pet trade. Their small size, combined with their tendency to live in large, easily visible groups, makes them vulnerable to poaching and human interference. While some squirrel monkey populations are stable in protected areas, others are declining and are listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
Star-Nosed Mole,20-Dec,Up to 0.06,"Black, Pink",Up to 4,Insectivore,"Wetlands, Forests",Not Applicable,1.2,North America,Least Concern,Talpidae,16-22,1.2,Solitary,10-Feb,"The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is a fascinating and unique mammal native to North America, primarily found in the wetlands, marshes, and forests of the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. This small, burrowing mammal is most easily recognized by the distinctive star-shaped structure on its snout, which consists of 22 fleshy, pink appendages. These appendages, known as sensory rays, are covered in highly sensitive touch receptors and give the mole an extraordinary sense of touch. The star-nosed mole's snout is often described as looking like a starfish, and it plays a critical role in the mole's ability to detect and interact with its environment.

The star-nosed mole is a relatively small creature, typically measuring about 6 to 8 inches in length, with a weight of just 2 to 3 ounces. It has velvety, dark brown fur, small eyes (which are not very functional, as the mole is nearly blind), and powerful front limbs adapted for digging. The mole’s body is well-suited for a subterranean lifestyle, with short, stocky legs and large, shovel-like hands that allow it to burrow efficiently through soil in search of food. Despite being a poor sighted animal, its reliance on touch, rather than sight, helps it thrive in its underground habitat.

The star-nosed mole's most remarkable feature is its star-shaped nose, which contains over 25,000 sensory receptors, making it one of the most sensitive structures in the animal kingdom. The mole uses its star to explore its environment, especially to locate prey. The star moves constantly, touching the ground in rapid, circular motions to detect vibrations and changes in texture. This sensitivity allows the mole to detect prey in as little as 120 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest foragers in the animal kingdom. The mole’s primary diet consists of small invertebrates such as worms, insects, and other subterranean animals, but it is also known to eat small fish, amphibians, and even plants in certain cases.

Star-nosed moles are voracious eaters and consume up to half of their body weight in food every day. Their high metabolic rate and energy needs require them to forage almost continuously, as they do not store food for later consumption. When hunting, the mole uses its star to rapidly probe the soil for prey. Once it detects a potential meal, it grabs it with its powerful jaws and eats it quickly. The mole’s ability to capture and process food at such a rapid pace is one of the reasons it is considered one of the fastest-feeding mammals.

Despite their excellent ability to detect and capture prey, star-nosed moles have relatively short lifespans, typically living about 3 years in the wild. Their primary predators include birds of prey, foxes, and other carnivores that can locate them through their tunnels. However, due to their underground lifestyle and the protection offered by their burrowing behavior, star-nosed moles are generally well-protected from most threats.

The star-nosed mole is an important part of its ecosystem, as it helps to aerate the soil while tunneling and controls insect and invertebrate populations. Its burrowing also helps to break down organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in the soil. The mole’s ecological role highlights the importance of maintaining healthy wetland and forest habitats, where they can continue to thrive."
Sumatran Orangutan,66-100,23-56,Reddish-Brown,30-50,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Tigers, Humans",35,Sumatra,Critically Endangered,Hominidae,90-100,35,Solitary,1,"The Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) is a critically endangered species of orangutan native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. It is one of the three species of orangutans, the other two being the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and the recently recognized Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis). The Sumatran orangutan is distinct from its Bornean relative in several ways, including physical appearance, behavior, and habitat preferences. Sumatran orangutans tend to have longer, thicker fur that is a reddish-brown color, and their faces are more angular and have a distinctive beard, compared to the Bornean orangutan. These orangutans are also generally larger and more robust than their Bornean counterparts.

Sumatran orangutans are arboreal (tree-dwelling) creatures, spending most of their lives in the dense rainforests of Sumatra. These forests are rich in biodiversity, providing a vast array of fruits, leaves, and other vegetation that make up the bulk of the orangutan’s diet. They are primarily frugivores, meaning their diet mainly consists of fruit, though they will also consume leaves, bark, and insects when fruits are not readily available. The orangutan’s large, strong hands and feet are adapted for life in the trees, and they use them to grasp branches and move through the forest canopy with remarkable dexterity. Their long, powerful arms help them swing from tree to tree, and they are known for their solitary lifestyle, rarely forming large groups, unlike other primates.

The Sumatran orangutan is also known for its intelligence and complex behavior. These orangutans use tools, such as sticks, to help them gather food or defend themselves. They are capable of problem-solving and are known to demonstrate learning behaviors, which include using leaves as umbrellas to protect themselves from rain or as cushions to sit on. The social structure of Sumatran orangutans is typically solitary, with adult males living alone or in small, loose associations with females. Females, on the other hand, tend to stay in smaller home ranges, often accompanied by their young. Orangutans have a long gestation period of about 8.5 months, and they give birth to a single infant, which stays dependent on the mother for an extended period, usually 6 to 7 years. This slow reproductive rate, combined with habitat loss and other threats, makes the species especially vulnerable to extinction.

Sadly, the Sumatran orangutan is critically endangered, with fewer than 15,000 individuals remaining in the wild, and their population continues to decline. Habitat destruction, primarily due to deforestation for palm oil plantations, logging, and agricultural expansion, poses the greatest threat to their survival. The destruction of their forest habitat not only reduces the space available for the orangutans to live but also limits their access to food. Additionally, illegal hunting and the pet trade further exacerbate the species' plight. In some cases, orangutans are captured for the illegal wildlife trade, where they are often kept in captivity as exotic pets or entertainment animals."
Sumatran Rhino,100-145,750-950,Reddish-Brown,30-45,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Tigers, Humans",40,Southeast Asia,Critically Endangered,Rhinocerotidae,430-640,40,Solitary,1,"The Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is one of the smallest and most endangered species of rhino, native to the forests of Sumatra and Borneo in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its relatively small size compared to other rhino species, with adults standing about 3 to 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing between 500 to 1,000 kilograms (1,100 to 2,200 pounds). The Sumatran rhino has a distinctive appearance, with a thick, hairy coat that helps it regulate temperature in the humid, forested environments where it resides. Its body is covered with patches of dark, coarse hair, and it has two horns—one on the nose and one on the forehead—though the forehead horn is often smaller than the nasal horn.

The Sumatran rhino is a herbivore, feeding on a wide variety of vegetation, including leaves, fruits, branches, and bark. It is primarily a solitary animal, preferring to roam alone through the dense rainforests, although it may occasionally encounter other rhinos. These animals are generally nocturnal, with much of their feeding and movement occurring at night. Despite being large and powerful, Sumatran rhinos are elusive and secretive creatures, rarely seen in the wild. Their primary habitats include lowland rainforests and mountain forests, where they can find abundant vegetation and water sources.

Reproduction in Sumatran rhinos is slow, as they have a long gestation period of about 15 to 16 months, one of the longest of any mammal. After this lengthy gestation, females give birth to a single calf, which stays with the mother for several years before becoming independent. Sumatran rhinos typically reach sexual maturity at around 5 to 6 years of age, but they do not breed regularly, which compounds their vulnerability to extinction. In the wild, they live an average of 30 to 40 years, though their life expectancy in captivity is often shorter due to the challenges of maintaining them in zoos.

Unfortunately, the Sumatran rhino is critically endangered, with only a few dozen individuals remaining in the wild. Habitat loss is the primary threat to the species, as large areas of forest are being cleared for palm oil plantations, logging, and human settlement. This deforestation fragments their habitat, making it difficult for rhinos to find mates, food, and suitable places to live. Additionally, poaching for their horns and other body parts is another significant threat, although it is not as prevalent as for other rhino species. The Sumatran rhino’s low reproductive rate and the shrinking size of its population have made it increasingly difficult for the species to recover.

The conservation of the Sumatran rhino is a critical concern for wildlife conservationists. Efforts to protect the species focus on habitat preservation, with a particular emphasis on protecting the remaining rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo. Conservation organizations are also working on anti-poaching initiatives, monitoring rhino populations, and establishing wildlife corridors to reduce habitat fragmentation. Captive breeding programs have been established in some zoos, though successful breeding in captivity has been limited. As of now, several individuals remain in sanctuaries in Indonesia, where they are monitored and cared for in hopes of boosting the species' numbers."
Sumatran Tiger,70-87,47-121,"Orange, Black Stripes",15-20,Carnivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",24,Sumatra,Critically Endangered,Felidae,140-230,24,Solitary,05-Jan,"The Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) is a critically endangered subspecies of tiger native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. It is the smallest of the remaining tiger subspecies, with males weighing around 220 to 310 pounds and females being smaller at 165 to 240 pounds. Sumatran tigers have a distinctive appearance, with a rich orange coat marked by dark, bold stripes. These stripes, along with the white underbelly and a pair of white spots behind the ears, help the tiger blend into the dense tropical forests of Sumatra. Their relatively smaller size compared to other tiger subspecies is an adaptation to the island’s environment, where the dense forest and rugged terrain require greater agility and stealth.

Sumatran tigers are solitary creatures, except during mating or when a mother is raising her cubs. They are primarily carnivorous and are apex predators in their habitat, preying on a wide range of animals, including deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals, such as monkeys and birds. They are also known to occasionally hunt livestock when their natural prey is scarce. Their hunting strategy involves stealth and patience, stalking their prey until they are within striking distance before launching a surprise attack. Sumatran tigers are territorial animals, with each adult maintaining a large home range that they defend aggressively from other tigers. The boundaries of these territories are marked by scent markings, such as urine and scratch marks, and territorial disputes are not uncommon.

The Sumatran tiger's habitat consists of the lowland rainforests and mountainous regions of Sumatra, which provide dense cover and an abundance of prey. The forests also offer the tigers water sources like rivers and streams, which are important for survival in the humid tropical climate. Unfortunately, the island’s forests are rapidly being destroyed due to logging, agriculture, and illegal palm oil plantations, which has significantly reduced the tiger's natural habitat. Habitat fragmentation is another major concern, as it isolates tiger populations, making it difficult for them to find mates and food. This has led to a sharp decline in the tiger population, with fewer than 400 individuals left in the wild.
Captive breeding programs are also part of the conservation strategy, though these have had limited success due to the small number of genetically diverse individuals in captivity. Ensuring that tigers can roam freely in their natural habitats and have access to sufficient prey is essential for their survival. Conservationists are also working to raise awareness among local communities about the importance of protecting these majestic animals, highlighting the role tigers play in maintaining the health of the ecosystem.
Conservation efforts to save the Sumatran tiger are ongoing and focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and community engagement. Organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Indonesian government are working to establish protected areas and wildlife corridors to help preserve tiger habitats and reduce human-tiger conflict. Anti-poaching patrols are being implemented, and the enforcement of wildlife protection laws has been strengthened. Additionally, efforts to promote sustainable practices, such as sustainable palm oil production, aim to reduce the impact of agricultural expansion on tiger habitats."
Sun Bear,120-150,27-80,Black,25-30,Omnivore,Tropical Forests,"Tigers, Leopards",32-56,Southeast Asia,Vulnerable,Ursidae,90-150,32-56,Solitary,02-Jan,"The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is the smallest species of bear, native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Adult sun bears typically weigh between 60 to 150 pounds and measure about 4 to 5 feet in length. Despite their small size compared to other bears, sun bears have powerful limbs and sharp claws, which they use for climbing trees and foraging for food. Their most distinctive feature is the crescent-shaped patch of yellow or white fur on their chest, which is thought to resemble the sun, giving the species its name. This chest marking is unique to each individual, much like a human fingerprint.

Sun bears are primarily nocturnal and solitary, spending most of their time in the dense forests and rainforests of Southeast Asia. They are excellent climbers, using their strong forelimbs and claws to scale trees in search of food, shelter, or to avoid predators. Their diet is omnivorous and highly varied, including fruits, berries, insects, honey, small vertebrates, and even roots. The sun bear is known for its love of honey, and it will use its long, curved claws to tear into beehives and extract honeycomb. Their sharp sense of smell helps them locate food, and their long tongues, which can extend up to 9 inches, are perfect for reaching into narrow crevices to extract honey or insects from trees.

Sun bears are solitary animals that tend to have large home ranges, which they mark with scent glands located near their tail. Males usually have larger ranges than females, and they are more likely to roam over a wider area in search of food or mates. The social interactions of sun bears are minimal, but they communicate through vocalizations, scent marking, and body language. Their primary means of communication are growls, roars, and other sounds, which can serve to warn off other bears or signal aggression.

Reproduction in sun bears is relatively slow, with a female giving birth to a single cub after a gestation period of about 95 to 120 days. Cubs are born blind and completely dependent on their mother for care. They remain with their mother for the first few years of life, during which time they learn essential survival skills, such as foraging and climbing. Like many bear species, sun bears have a long maturation period and typically reach sexual maturity at around 3 to 4 years of age. The mother-cub bond is strong, and the cubs stay with their mother until they are capable of surviving independently in the wild.

Unfortunately, the sun bear is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with populations declining due to habitat loss, poaching, and illegal wildlife trade. Habitat destruction, primarily driven by deforestation for palm oil plantations, logging, and agriculture, is the greatest threat to sun bears. As the forests are cleared, sun bears lose their natural habitat and food sources, and they are often forced into closer proximity to human settlements, where they can be killed or captured. Sun bears are also hunted for their body parts, which are used in traditional medicine, or captured for the illegal pet trade."
Tapir,70-120,150-400,"Brown, Black",25-30,Herbivore,"Rainforests, Grasslands","Jaguars, Crocodiles",48,South and Central America,Vulnerable,Tapiridae,390-395,48,Solitary,1,"The tapir is a large, herbivorous mammal belonging to the family Tapiridae, and it is found in Central and South America, as well as parts of Southeast Asia. Tapirs are easily recognizable by their distinctive, flexible, and elongated snouts, which resemble trunks. This unique feature is actually an extension of their upper lip, and it serves multiple functions, including helping them grasp leaves, fruits, and branches from trees and shrubs. Tapirs have a somewhat stocky, barrel-shaped body covered in coarse hair, and their legs are relatively short but strong. Despite their large size, tapirs are generally quiet and elusive animals, often living in dense, tropical forests or wetlands where they can find adequate food and shelter.

There are four extant species of tapir: the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris) in South America, the Baird’s tapir (Tapirus bairdii) in Central America, the Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) in Southeast Asia, and the mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) in the Andes Mountains of South America. Each species has its own unique traits and habitat preferences. The Malayan tapir, for example, is characterized by its striking black and white coloration, with a dark body and a white patch that extends from its chest to its hindquarters. In contrast, the Brazilian tapir is mostly brown, while the Baird’s tapir has a more uniform color and is typically brown or grayish.

Tapirs are primarily herbivores, feeding on a variety of plant material such as leaves, fruits, twigs, and aquatic vegetation. Their flexible snouts allow them to grab food from the ground or high up in trees, making them opportunistic feeders that can adjust their diet depending on the availability of resources. They are known to be excellent swimmers and are often found near water sources such as rivers, lakes, and marshes. Tapirs use their strong limbs to paddle through water, and they are also able to dive underwater, which helps them evade predators and navigate through their wetland habitats. They also utilize their snouts to forage underwater, rooting around for aquatic plants.

Reproduction in tapirs is relatively slow. After a gestation period of about 13 months, female tapirs give birth to a single calf. The calf is born with distinctive white spots and stripes on its dark coat, which help it blend into the underbrush and avoid predators. Over time, the calf's coat darkens, and the spots and stripes fade. Calves are dependent on their mothers for protection and nourishment for the first year of life, after which they begin to forage on their own but may stay with their mothers for a few more years.

Despite their ability to adapt to a variety of environments, tapirs are currently at risk due to habitat loss, hunting, and fragmentation of their ecosystems. Deforestation, primarily for agriculture and logging, poses the most significant threat to tapir populations, as their natural habitats are destroyed or fragmented. The Malayan tapir, in particular, faces threats from habitat destruction and hunting, while other species are increasingly vulnerable due to the loss of food sources and safe habitats. Tapirs are also hunted for their meat, and in some regions, they are captured for the illegal pet trade. The combination of these threats has led to the classification of some species of tapirs as endangered or vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
Tarsier,Up to 16,Up to 0.2,"Gray, Brown",20,Insectivore,Rainforests,"Birds, Snakes",40-50,"Southeast Asia, Philippines",Vulnerable,Tarsiidae,180-210,40-50,Solitary,1,"The tarsier is a small, nocturnal primate known for its large eyes, which are disproportionately large compared to the size of its head. Native to Southeast Asia, tarsiers are found primarily in the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra. These eyes are adaptations to their nocturnal lifestyle, allowing them to see in low light conditions. Each eye is about the size of its brain, and they are fixed in the socket, meaning tarsiers must turn their heads almost 180 degrees to look around. Their large eyes help them spot insects and small vertebrates, which make up the majority of their diet.

Tarsiers are small, with most species measuring about 4 to 6 inches in body length, with an additional 7 to 10 inches of tail. Their bodies are covered in soft fur, which ranges from light brown to grayish tones, helping them blend into the foliage. One of their most distinctive features, besides their large eyes, is their long fingers and toes, particularly the elongated second and third toes, which they use to grasp tree branches while leaping. Tarsiers are excellent climbers, using their strong hind limbs and flexible feet to leap between trees in search of food and to escape predators. They are also known for their sharp, pointed teeth, which are suited to their carnivorous diet.

Tarsiers are strictly insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, small birds, and even reptiles. They are also known to catch prey by leaping from tree branches and pouncing on their target. Their keen sense of hearing helps them locate prey, as they rely on both sight and sound to track their food. Tarsiers typically hunt alone, but some species may share their home range with others. They are known for their agile and swift movements, often making dramatic leaps between trees, thanks to their powerful hind limbs. Their diet is mostly made up of insects like crickets, moths, and beetles, but they may also consume small vertebrates when the opportunity arises.

Reproduction in tarsiers is relatively slow compared to other primates. Female tarsiers usually give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of around six months. The newborn is born fully furred and with its eyes open, and it clings to the mother's belly for several weeks after birth. Tarsiers are known to have a very tight-knit bond between mother and offspring, with the mother providing all the care and protection to the young. Young tarsiers mature slowly, reaching independence around six months of age. During this time, they learn important survival skills, such as how to hunt and navigate the trees.

Unfortunately, tarsiers face several threats to their survival. Habitat destruction, particularly due to deforestation, is the greatest threat to tarsiers, as it destroys the dense forest environments they depend on for food and shelter. The expansion of agriculture, logging, and human settlements has led to significant habitat fragmentation, making it difficult for tarsiers to find sufficient food and suitable places to live. In some areas, hunting and the illegal pet trade also pose threats to their population. Tarsiers are sometimes captured for the exotic pet trade due to their small size and unique appearance, but this often leads to their death, as their diet and care needs are difficult to meet in captivity."
Tasmanian Devil,30-76,14-Apr,"Black, White",8,"Carnivore, Scavenger","Forests, Grasslands",Tasmanian Tigers,16,"Tasmania, Australia",Endangered,Dasyuridae,21-28,16,Solitary,20-30,"The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is a carnivorous marsupial native to the island of Tasmania, located off the southern coast of Australia. Known for its stocky build, black fur, and aggressive behavior, the Tasmanian devil is one of the most iconic animals of Australia, although it has become increasingly rare in the wild. It is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial, with adults weighing between 9 to 14 kilograms (20 to 30 pounds) and measuring about 60 to 80 cm (2 to 2.6 feet) in body length. Despite their fearsome reputation, Tasmanian devils are scavengers, typically feeding on the carcasses of dead animals, although they are also known to hunt small prey.

Tasmanian devils have a distinctive appearance, with muscular jaws and large teeth that enable them to break through tough hides and bones. They are named for the frightening sounds they make while feeding, which resemble growls, screeches, and coughing sounds, giving them a somewhat demonic appearance to early European settlers. Their black fur is often interspersed with white markings on the chest and rump. The devils have a strong sense of smell, which they use to locate carrion from miles away, and they are known for their scavenging habits, often feeding on the remains of larger animals like wombats, wallabies, and sheep. They are also opportunistic feeders and will consume small mammals, birds, and reptiles when available.

Tasmanian devils are primarily solitary animals, although they may gather around a food source, especially when they find a large carcass. They are nocturnal and spend the daytime in dens, which can be located in caves, hollow logs, or burrows. They are incredibly territorial and will often fight aggressively over food or space. Their vocalizations during these interactions are loud and varied, which further fuels their intimidating reputation. Tasmanian devils communicate through growls, hisses, and screeches, which are often heard during feeding and territorial disputes.

Reproduction in Tasmanian devils is relatively short and straightforward. Mating usually occurs in the early summer, and females give birth to a small litter of 2 to 4 tiny, underdeveloped joeys after a gestation period of about 21 days. The newborns, which are the size of a pea, immediately crawl into the mother's pouch, where they continue to develop for several months. Once they leave the pouch, the joeys continue to suckle and remain in the mother's den until they are old enough to venture out and begin foraging on their own. Tasmanian devils reach sexual maturity at around 2 years of age, and their lifespan in the wild is typically 5 to 6 years, though some may live longer in captivity.

The Tasmanian devil has faced significant challenges to its survival in recent decades. The primary threat to the species is a transmissible form of cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), which was first observed in the mid-1990s. This disease is highly contagious, spreading through bites and scratches, and it causes the development of tumors on the face and mouth of the affected devils. Over time, the tumors prevent the animals from feeding properly, leading to starvation and death. DFTD has caused a dramatic decline in the Tasmanian devil population, with estimates suggesting that the population has decreased by more than 80% in the past 20 years. The disease is a major factor in the species' classification as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
Tasmanian Tiger,100-130,20-30,Yellow-brown,7,Carnivore,Australia,"Humans, Dingoes",40-72,Australia,Extinct,Thylacinidae,121-128,40-72,Solitary,1-4 (usually 2-3),"The Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), was a carnivorous marsupial native to Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea. It is most famous for its dog-like appearance, featuring a slender, elongated body, a head with a pointed snout, and large, rounded ears. Its name ""Tasmanian tiger"" comes from the distinctive stripes on its back and tail, which resemble those of a tiger, though it was not related to true tigers. Thylacines were relatively large, measuring up to 4 feet in length, with an additional 2-3 feet of tail, and standing about 2 feet tall at the shoulder. Adult thylacines weighed between 15 to 30 kilograms (33 to 66 pounds).

Thylacines were nocturnal, solitary creatures that primarily hunted small to medium-sized prey, such as birds, small mammals, and reptiles. They were skilled hunters and scavengers, capable of chasing down prey with their strong jaws, though they were also known to take advantage of carrion when available. Their hunting style was somewhat similar to that of a large dog, but unlike dogs, thylacines did not hunt in packs and preferred to work alone. They had a keen sense of hearing and sight, which aided them in locating their prey. Their distinctive striped coat provided some camouflage in the dense forests and grasslands they inhabited, particularly in Tasmania.

Thylacines were marsupials, which means that females carried their young in a pouch, much like kangaroos. After a gestation period of about 30 days, female thylacines gave birth to underdeveloped young, which then crawled into the mother's pouch to continue developing. Once they were too large for the pouch, the young would remain in the den with the mother until they were ready to venture out and hunt. The reproductive rate of thylacines was relatively low, with females typically producing a litter of 2 to 4 joeys.

The thylacine was once widely distributed across Australia and New Guinea, but by the time European settlers arrived, its population had already begun to decline. The primary reasons for this decline were hunting and habitat loss. Early European settlers viewed the thylacine as a threat to livestock, particularly sheep, and they hunted the animal relentlessly. Additionally, the clearing of land for agriculture and the introduction of predators like dogs and foxes further contributed to the thylacine’s dwindling numbers. Despite its ability to adapt to a variety of environments, the thylacine’s slow reproductive rate and its tendency to remain elusive made it vulnerable to overhunting and environmental changes.

By the early 20th century, the thylacine had been pushed to the brink of extinction in the wild, with the last known wild thylacine being captured in 1930. In 1936, the last known captive thylacine, a female named ""Benjamin,"" died at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania, marking the species as officially extinct. There have been numerous unconfirmed reports of sightings of the thylacine in the years since, leading some to believe that the species might still exist in remote parts of Tasmania, but no definitive evidence has ever been found."
Termite,Up to 0.5,Up to 0.02,Varies,Varies,Herbivore,"Forests, Grasslands",Not Applicable,Varies,Worldwide,Not Applicable,Termitoidae,Varies,Varies,Social groups,Varies,"Termites are small, social insects known for their ability to break down cellulose, which is found in wood, plant material, and other organic matter. They are sometimes referred to as ""white ants"" due to their similar appearance, but they are not actually ants. Instead, termites belong to the order Isoptera, and are more closely related to cockroaches. There are over 2,700 species of termites, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica. They play a vital ecological role in breaking down plant material and recycling nutrients back into the environment. However, some species of termites are notorious for their ability to damage wooden structures, which has earned them a reputation as pests.

Termites live in highly organized colonies that can number from a few hundred to several million individuals, depending on the species. The colony consists of several castes: the queen, king, workers, soldiers, and reproductive termites. The queen and king are responsible for reproduction, and the queen can lay thousands of eggs per day. Workers, which are sterile, make up the majority of the colony and are responsible for foraging, building and maintaining the nest, and caring for the queen's offspring. Soldiers have large mandibles or jaws and defend the colony from predators like ants and other threats. Reproductive termites, also known as alates, are the winged termites that leave the colony to mate and start new colonies.

Termites primarily feed on cellulose, which is abundant in plant material, and they obtain this food by digesting it with the help of symbiotic microorganisms in their gut. These microorganisms break down the tough cellulose fibers, allowing termites to extract the nutrients they need. This feeding behavior makes termites crucial decomposers in ecosystems, as they help break down dead wood, fallen leaves, and other organic matter, turning it into nutrients that are recycled back into the soil. In this way, termites help to maintain the health and fertility of ecosystems, particularly in forests, savannas, and grasslands.

Most termite species are subterranean, meaning they live in underground colonies, although some species are arboreal or live in wood. Subterranean termites build extensive tunnel systems below the surface of the soil, which they use to travel from their nests to food sources, typically wood. They are known for their ability to consume wood silently and efficiently, often going unnoticed until the damage becomes severe. Drywood termites, on the other hand, live inside the wood they consume, which can make them harder to detect, as they do not require contact with the soil."
Thorny Devil,Up to 20,Up to 85,"Brown, Tan",20,Insectivore,"Desert, Scrublands","Birds, Snakes",0.16-0.32,Australia,Least Concern,Agamidae,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"
The thorny devil (Moloch horridus) is a unique and fascinating lizard native to the arid regions of central and western Australia. Recognizable for its distinctive appearance, the thorny devil is covered in sharp, spiny protrusions that help protect it from predators by making it appear larger and more intimidating. These spines are not only a defense mechanism but also help the lizard conserve water in its harsh desert environment. The body of the thorny devil is typically brown or reddish-brown, blending well with the dry, rocky landscapes it inhabits. It is a relatively small reptile, measuring up to 20 cm (8 inches) in body length, with its tail adding a few extra centimeters.

One of the most remarkable features of the thorny devil is its ability to collect water. The lizard has specialized grooves on its skin that channel dew or rainwater to its mouth. These grooves run from its head down to its belly, and when the thorny devil encounters moisture, it can drink by tilting its head and allowing the water to travel along these channels. This ability is crucial in the arid environments it inhabits, where fresh water is scarce. Thorny devils can survive on very little water, relying on dew and rainfall to meet their hydration needs. This adaptation helps them thrive in environments where many other animals would struggle to survive.

The thorny devil is an insectivore, with a diet primarily consisting of ants. Its long, sticky tongue is used to capture the ants, which make up the bulk of its diet. The lizard can consume large numbers of ants in a single feeding session, and it has been observed to eat more than 10,000 ants in one day when food is abundant. The thorny devil is a patient hunter, slowly stalking its prey and using its tongue to collect ants one by one. Despite its small size, the thorny devil is highly adapted for this specialized diet and has evolved to be able to consume ants efficiently.

The thorny devil's behavior is largely solitary and slow-moving, making it well-suited to its dry desert habitat. It is not particularly agile or fast, but it compensates for this with its camouflage. The spiny body helps the thorny devil blend into its surroundings, making it difficult for predators to spot. When threatened, the thorny devil will often remain motionless, relying on its camouflage to avoid detection. If disturbed, the lizard may flatten its body and puff up its spines, making it appear even more threatening to potential predators. It may also attempt to escape by moving in a series of short, jerky movements, which can make it harder for predators to catch.

Reproduction in thorny devils occurs during the cooler months, usually between August and November, after which females lay up to 3 eggs in a burrow or a hidden spot in the ground. The eggs incubate for several months, and the young hatch in late spring or early summer. The hatchlings are small versions of the adults, equipped with the same protective spines, and they are immediately capable of feeding on ants. The thorny devil does not engage in parental care, and the young are left to fend for themselves after hatching."
Three-Toed Sloth,46-58,Up to 8,"Brown, Gray",10,Herbivore,Rainforests,Harpy Eagles,20,Central and South America,Least Concern,Bradypodidae,30-40,20,Solitary,02-Jan,"The three-toed sloth (Bradypus spp.) is a slow-moving, tree-dwelling mammal native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Known for its lethargic pace and distinctive appearance, the three-toed sloth is one of the most unique and easily recognizable animals in the world. Unlike its two-toed relatives, the three-toed sloth has three long claws on each of its limbs, which it uses to hang upside down from tree branches. These claws are curved and strong, perfectly adapted for gripping tree branches and supporting the sloth’s weight as it moves through the canopy.

Three-toed sloths are arboreal creatures, spending most of their lives in the trees. They are primarily nocturnal, though they are active at any time of day, moving slowly through the branches in search of food. Their diet mainly consists of leaves, which they are able to digest with the help of a slow metabolic rate and a large, multi-chambered stomach. The sloth’s digestive system is particularly inefficient, and it can take up to a month to fully process a single meal. This slow digestion contributes to their overall slow pace, as they have limited energy reserves and do not need to expend much energy on movement. Sloths also consume fruits, flowers, and buds when available, but leaves make up the bulk of their diet. The leaves they eat are often low in nutrition, which is why they have evolved to move and feed slowly.

One of the most notable characteristics of three-toed sloths is their incredibly slow movement. On the ground, they move at a sluggish pace of about 0.03 miles per hour (0.05 km/h), but in the trees, they are a bit quicker, using their long claws to grasp branches and pull themselves along. Despite their slow movement, sloths are excellent swimmers. They are able to move through water much more quickly than on land, using their long limbs to paddle and their low body density to float. Sloths are known to swim across rivers and streams in search of food or to escape predators.

Sloths are solitary animals, spending most of their time alone in the treetops, and they are generally not territorial. They are known to communicate with one another using vocalizations, including screams and high-pitched calls, particularly during mating season. Sloths also have a unique and fascinating relationship with the environment. Their fur often harbors algae, which gives them a greenish tint and helps them blend into the canopy, offering some camouflage from predators like jaguars and harpy eagles. This algae also provides a small amount of nutrition to the sloth, as they occasionally nibble on it.

Reproduction in three-toed sloths is slow and infrequent, reflecting their overall slow life strategy. Female sloths give birth to a single baby after a gestation period of about six months. The young are born with their eyes open and are able to grasp onto their mother’s fur almost immediately. They stay close to their mothers for several months, riding on her belly until they are old enough to start climbing and feeding on their own. Sloths have a relatively long lifespan for their size, living for up to 30 years in the wild, though most sloths live for around 20 years."
Tibetan Mastiff,61-78,63-75,"Black, Brown, Gray",12,Omnivore,Human Dwellings,Not Applicable,45,"Asia, Tibet",Not Applicable,Canidae,58-82,45,Social groups,10-Jan,"The Tibetan Mastiff is a large and powerful dog breed that originated in the Himalayas and Tibet, where it was traditionally used by nomadic cultures as a guard dog for livestock and property. Known for its impressive size, thick coat, and protective nature, the Tibetan Mastiff has a long history as a guardian and protector in harsh and remote environments. These dogs were specifically bred to protect sheep, goats, and other livestock from predators like wolves, leopards, and bears, as well as intruders. Tibetan Mastiffs are considered one of the oldest and most primitive dog breeds, with a lineage dating back thousands of years.

One of the most striking features of the Tibetan Mastiff is its massive size. Adult males typically weigh between 90 to 150 pounds (40 to 68 kilograms), with females being slightly smaller. They stand between 24 and 30 inches (61 to 76 cm) tall at the shoulder, though some individuals can be even taller. Their bodies are muscular and robust, built for strength and endurance. The Tibetan Mastiff's thick, double-layered coat is another distinctive feature. The outer coat is long and dense, while the undercoat is soft and insulating. This coat helps protect the dog from cold temperatures in the harsh mountain environment. The breed also has a mane of fur around its neck, making it look even more imposing, especially in males. Coat colors can vary and include shades of black, brown, gold, and red, often with markings on the chest, paws, or face.

Tibetan Mastiffs are known for their independent and aloof temperament, which is one of the reasons they were so effective as guard dogs. They are highly protective of their families and territory, and they can be wary of strangers. While they are loyal and affectionate toward their owners, they are often reserved and selective in their interactions with others. This aloofness is not a sign of aggression but rather a result of their natural guarding instincts. Tibetan Mastiffs are intelligent and capable of making their own decisions, which can sometimes lead to a stubborn streak. This independent nature requires an experienced and assertive owner who can provide consistent training and leadership.

In terms of exercise, Tibetan Mastiffs are moderately active. While they are not as energetic as some other breeds, they do require regular exercise to maintain their health and prevent boredom. Daily walks and time spent outdoors are essential, but these dogs are not typically suited for high-intensity activities. Due to their size and protective instincts, they need ample space to roam, and they are best suited to homes with large yards or access to open areas. However, their natural guarding instincts make them ideal for rural or suburban environments rather than crowded urban settings.

When it comes to grooming, the Tibetan Mastiff’s thick coat requires regular maintenance. They shed heavily, particularly during seasonal changes, and regular brushing is necessary to prevent matting and tangling. Their grooming needs can be time-consuming, but the effort is worth it to keep their coat healthy and manageable. Regular bathing is also important to maintain the health of their skin and coat, though over-bathing should be avoided as it can strip away natural oils."
Tiger,108-133,100-390,"Orange, Black Stripes",15,Carnivore,Rainforests,"Humans, Leopards",28,"Asia, Russia",Endangered,Felidae,280-310,28,Solitary,04-Jan,"The tiger (Panthera tigris) is one of the most iconic and powerful big cats in the world, known for its strength, beauty, and predatory prowess. Native to Asia, tigers are found in a variety of habitats, from tropical forests and grasslands to temperate woodlands and mangrove swamps. Tigers are the largest members of the cat family, with males often weighing between 400 and 675 pounds (180 to 306 kg) and measuring up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length, including their tail. Their distinct orange coat, marked with black stripes, provides excellent camouflage in their natural environment, helping them stalk prey unnoticed. Each tiger’s pattern of stripes is unique, much like human fingerprints.

Tigers are solitary animals, and they prefer to live alone, except during mating or when a mother is raising her cubs. They are territorial, with large home ranges that vary depending on the availability of prey and habitat. Male tigers typically have larger territories than females and will defend them aggressively against other males. Tigers are primarily nocturnal hunters, relying on stealth to approach and ambush their prey. They are carnivorous and have a diet consisting mainly of large ungulates, such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. While they are capable of taking down large animals, tigers will also hunt smaller mammals and birds when necessary. Their powerful jaws and sharp claws make them formidable hunters, capable of delivering a fatal bite to the neck or throat of their prey.

One of the most notable characteristics of tigers is their physical strength. They have muscular bodies designed for powerful bursts of speed, which they use to close the distance between themselves and their prey. Though they are not as fast over long distances as some other predators, tigers are capable of reaching speeds of 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) in short sprints. Their large paws and strong forelimbs allow them to overpower their prey, and their retractable claws give them the ability to grasp and hold onto struggling animals. After a successful hunt, tigers often drag their kill into a secluded area to feed, keeping other predators, such as vultures or scavengers, away from the carcass.

Tigers are known for their powerful roar, which can be heard from over a mile away. This roar is used for communication, signaling their presence to other tigers and establishing their dominance over a territory. In addition to vocalizations, tigers also communicate through scent marking, using urine and feces to mark boundaries and leave messages for other tigers. They also use visual cues, such as scratching trees or marking them with scent glands on their face, to indicate their territory.

Tigers are solitary in nature but have a complex social structure when it comes to mating. Mating occurs year-round, though there may be peaks depending on the region. Female tigers give birth to litters of one to five cubs, with an average of two or three. The cubs are born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mother for care and protection. Over the course of the first few months, the cubs grow rapidly, and by the age of two, they begin to hunt on their own, although they may continue to stay with their mother for up to three years before establishing their own territories."
Titanoboa,Up to 1440,Up to 24950,Dark Brown,15,Carnivore,Wetlands,"Fish, Crocodiles",27,South America,Extinct (around 58 million years ago),Boidae,420-470,27,Solitary,Not Applicable,"Titanoboa (Titanoboa cerrejonensis) was an enormous prehistoric snake that lived around 60 million years ago during the Paleocene epoch, shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs. It is considered the largest snake ever known to have existed, with estimates suggesting it could grow up to 42 feet (13 meters) in length and weigh as much as 2,500 pounds (1,135 kg). This massive serpent was discovered in 2009 in the Cerrejón coal mine in northern Colombia, South America, where its fossilized remains were found preserved in the ancient sediments. Titanoboa's discovery has provided valuable insights into the climate and ecosystems of the Paleocene, as well as the evolutionary history of serpents.

Titanoboa lived in a tropical environment that was much warmer than today, with average temperatures around 85 to 95°F (29 to 35°C). The hot, humid climate of the Paleocene allowed reptiles like Titanoboa to grow to such gigantic proportions, as warm-blooded animals were not yet dominant, and the ecosystem was more conducive to the development of large, cold-blooded creatures. The high temperatures of this time period also supported the abundance of prey, including large fish, amphibians, and other reptiles, which would have been ideal for Titanoboa's diet. Titanoboa is believed to have hunted by ambushing its prey, constricting and suffocating it, much like modern-day boas and pythons. Its enormous size would have allowed it to overpower and swallow large prey whole, such as crocodiles and large fish.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Titanoboa's size is how it compares to modern snakes. Today, the largest living snake species is the reticulated python, which can grow to around 30 feet (9 meters) in length. However, Titanoboa far exceeded this length, with its massive body likely supported by a combination of factors such as the higher oxygen levels in the atmosphere and the warmer climate of the Paleocene. The increased oxygen content would have allowed Titanoboa's muscles and organs to function at a much larger scale, enabling it to achieve its extreme size. Its long, muscular body would have been capable of swift movements in the water, where it is believed to have hunted, as well as on land.

Despite its fearsome size, Titanoboa's existence was short-lived, and it disappeared around 58 million years ago, likely due to changing climatic conditions. As the Earth's temperatures began to drop and ecosystems began to shift, the environment that supported such giant reptiles became less favorable. The cooling of the planet and the decline in tropical environments would have reduced the available prey for Titanoboa, contributing to its eventual extinction. However, the fossil evidence of Titanoboa remains one of the most striking examples of the extreme sizes some animals were capable of reaching in the past.

Titanoboa's discovery and the study of its fossils have shed light on the ancient ecosystems of the Paleocene. The fossils show that this massive snake was not only an apex predator in its environment but also a part of a diverse ecosystem teeming with large reptiles and amphibians. The findings have also prompted further exploration into the evolutionary development of snakes and how environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen levels, and prey availability have influenced their size and behavior over millions of years."
Toco Toucan,55-65,540-700,"Black, Orange, Yellow",10,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Birds of Prey, Jaguars",29-42,South America,Least Concern,Ramphastidae,17-20,56-64,Flocks,04-Feb,"The toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) is one of the most iconic and recognizable birds in the world, known for its vibrant plumage and enormous, colorful beak. Native to South America, it is found primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions of countries like Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. The toco toucan is the largest species of toucan, standing around 25 inches (63 cm) in length, with the majority of its size taken up by its massive bill. Its striking beak, which can measure up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length, is bright orange with a black tip and is one of the bird’s most distinctive features. Despite its size, the beak is relatively light due to its hollow structure, which makes it more manageable for the bird to carry.

Toco toucans have a bold, colorful appearance, with a black body and white throat and chest. Their faces are marked with a patch of bright yellow or orange skin around the eyes, enhancing their colorful profile. The combination of their colorful beaks, vivid plumage, and bright skin makes them one of the most visually striking birds in their habitat. Their distinctive appearance has made them a symbol of tropical rainforests, often featured in popular culture and advertising. Their large beaks are not just for show; they are used for feeding, communication, and social interactions within flocks.

These birds are primarily frugivores, meaning that the majority of their diet consists of fruits, such as figs, bananas, and other tropical fruits. However, they are opportunistic eaters and will also consume insects, eggs, and small animals when available. The toco toucan uses its large bill to reach food high up in the trees and to grasp fruits. Interestingly, the toucan does not eat the entire fruit immediately but will often toss it into the air and catch it with its bill to break it into smaller pieces. This unique feeding behavior helps the toucan navigate the dense canopy of the rainforest and access food that might otherwise be out of reach for other birds.

Toco toucans are social birds and live in small groups or flocks, typically consisting of 2 to 5 individuals. These flocks are usually family groups, with individuals staying together for protection and to maintain access to food. Within these groups, toco toucans engage in playful interactions and often communicate using a series of calls and vocalizations, which include a variety of squawks, whistles, and croaky sounds. They may also use their bills in social interactions, gently tapping or bumping them against one another as a way to establish social bonds. Despite their social nature, they are not aggressive birds and tend to avoid confrontation.

Toco toucans are tree-dwelling birds, spending the majority of their time in the upper canopy of the rainforest. They are excellent climbers, using their strong feet and sharp claws to grip tree branches and navigate through the foliage. Their large beaks, though seemingly unwieldy, are highly maneuverable and are an essential tool for them as they forage for food and engage in social activities. Toco toucans are also adept at flying, though they typically fly short distances and prefer to hop or glide from branch to branch. Their wings are relatively small compared to their body size, making them better suited for short, controlled flights within the tree canopy rather than long-distance migration."
Tree Kangaroo,51-79,08-Apr,"Brown, Red",15-20,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Quolls, Pythons",30,"Papua New Guinea, Indonesia",Endangered,Macropodidae,126-130,30,Solitary,1,"The tree kangaroo is a unique and fascinating species of marsupial native to the rainforests of northern Australia, New Guinea, and surrounding islands. Unlike their ground-dwelling relatives, tree kangaroos are adapted to life in the trees and have evolved a set of physical traits that help them navigate the forest canopy. There are several species of tree kangaroos, with the most well-known being the Lumholtz's tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) found in the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. These animals are part of the Dendrolagus genus, which includes around 13 different species of tree-dwelling kangaroos.

Tree kangaroos are smaller than their ground-based cousins, such as the red kangaroo, but still possess the muscular hind legs characteristic of the kangaroo family. These powerful hind legs enable them to make strong leaps from tree to tree. However, their front limbs are also well-developed, with long, grasping hands that help them climb and maintain balance as they navigate the trees. Their thick, bushy tail is another adaptation that aids in balancing, providing them with stability while moving through the canopy. Unlike the larger kangaroo species, tree kangaroos have shorter, more compact bodies with broader feet and longer claws, making them adept at gripping branches and climbing vertically.

Tree kangaroos primarily inhabit tropical rainforests, where they spend most of their time in the lower to mid-level canopy. They are herbivores, feeding on a variety of plant materials such as leaves, fruit, flowers, and seeds. Their diet can vary depending on the species and the availability of food in their particular habitat. Tree kangaroos are known to be selective feeders, often choosing specific types of leaves or fruit, much like other herbivorous marsupials. Their diet also includes various types of flowers, shoots, and the occasional soft bark. They may travel from tree to tree in search of food, but they generally remain within a small range, particularly during the mating season.

Despite their arboreal lifestyle, tree kangaroos are not exclusively tree-bound; they are capable of descending to the forest floor, where they sometimes move to find food, shelter, or mates. However, they are generally slower and more vulnerable on the ground, as their legs are designed for jumping and climbing rather than running. They are primarily solitary animals, with each individual establishing its own territory within a particular area of the forest. Tree kangaroos are relatively quiet but communicate through vocalizations such as grunts, clicks, and soft barks. These sounds are often used in social interactions, such as mating or signaling their presence to other tree kangaroos.

The main threats to tree kangaroo populations come from habitat loss due to deforestation and hunting. As rainforests are cleared for agriculture, logging, and urban development, the tree kangaroo’s natural habitat is rapidly shrinking. This loss of habitat not only reduces the availability of food but also disrupts the complex tree canopy systems that these animals rely on for shelter and movement. In some regions, hunting and the illegal pet trade further threaten tree kangaroo populations. Several species of tree kangaroos are considered vulnerable or endangered, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their habitats and reduce human impact on their environment."
Tsetse Fly,Up to 0.7,Up to 0.03,"Brown, Gray",Up to 28,Carnivore,Savannahs,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Africa,Not Applicable,Glossinidae,Varies,Varies,Solitary,Varies,"The tsetse fly (Glossina species) is a large, biting insect native to sub-Saharan Africa, known for its role as a vector of serious diseases such as African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness in humans) and nagana in animals. Tsetse flies are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where they inhabit dense savannas, forests, and woodlands. There are about 30 species of tsetse flies, with two main groups based on their habitat preferences: the forest-dwelling species (Glossina palpalis) and the savannah species (Glossina morsitans). These flies are medium to large in size, with a characteristic reddish-brown or grayish color and a distinctive wing posture, where their wings are held outstretched over their bodies or folded in a ""V"" shape.

Tsetse flies are known for their biting behavior, with both male and female flies feeding on the blood of vertebrates. They are primarily attracted to their hosts by visual cues, body odor, and the warmth of the host’s body. The fly uses its sharp, piercing mouthparts to draw blood from animals, including humans, cattle, antelope, and other wildlife. Unlike many other flies that feed on nectar, tsetse flies require blood meals for nourishment and to produce eggs. Female tsetse flies, unlike most insects, give birth to live larvae instead of laying eggs. After mating, a female tsetse fly produces one larva at a time, which she nourishes inside her body before giving birth to it. The larva then burrows into the soil to pupate and eventually emerge as an adult fly.

The role of tsetse flies in the transmission of trypanosomes, the protozoan parasites that cause sleeping sickness and nagana, makes them a significant public health and economic concern. The trypanosomes are transmitted when a tsetse fly bites an infected animal or human, ingesting the parasite’s blood, and later injecting the parasite into another host. In humans, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) causes fever, headache, and joint pain in the early stages, and if left untreated, it can lead to neurological symptoms such as confusion, sleep disturbances, and ultimately death. In livestock, the disease known as nagana can cause anemia, weight loss, and reduced productivity, severely affecting agriculture and farming in affected regions.

Tsetse flies are most active during the day, especially in the early morning and late afternoon when they search for hosts. Their flight is typically slow and deliberate, allowing them to zero in on the targets. They are capable of flying several kilometers from their breeding areas to find food, but they typically stay within a range of their habitat. In addition to their blood-feeding behavior, tsetse flies are also important components of the ecosystems they inhabit, contributing to the food web by serving as prey for other animals like birds and reptiles.

Tsetse flies reproduce slowly compared to other insects, which is part of the reason why their populations can be so difficult to control. The flies have a relatively long lifespan for insects, living from a few weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. Their reproductive rate is low, as they only produce one offspring at a time and the larvae take weeks to develop before they are ready to pupate. This slow reproductive rate means that controlling tsetse populations requires significant effort, such as the use of insecticides, traps, and sterile insect techniques, where large numbers of sterile males are released into the wild to mate with females and reduce the fly population over time."
Tuatara,Up to 80,Up to 1.5,Grayish-brown,Up to 100,"Carnivore, Insectivore","Islands, Coastal Areas","Rats, Cats",0.03,New Zealand,Vulnerable,Rhynchocephalia,15-Dec,Not Applicable,Solitary,Up to 16,"The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is a unique and ancient reptile native to New Zealand, often referred to as a ""living fossil"" because it is the last surviving species of a once-diverse group of reptiles called Rhynchocephalia. This group of reptiles dates back over 200 million years, to the Mesozoic era, making the tuatara one of the most primitive living reptiles. The tuatara's closest relatives, now extinct, once roamed the Earth alongside dinosaurs, but the tuatara survived into modern times in isolated regions of New Zealand. Its survival has made it a key subject of scientific study, offering insight into the evolutionary history of reptiles.

The tuatara is often mistaken for a lizard due to its appearance, but it belongs to a distinct order of reptiles. It has a robust, spiny appearance with a crown of small spines along its back and a thick, triangular head. Adult tuataras typically grow to around 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) in length, with males being slightly larger than females. Their coloration is usually a muted brown or olive green, which helps them blend into their forested or rocky habitats. One of the most distinctive features of the tuatara is the presence of a ""third eye,"" or parietal eye, located on the top of its head. This eye, which is not used for vision in the traditional sense, helps regulate the reptile's circadian rhythms and is believed to play a role in temperature regulation and possibly in navigating its environment.

Tuatara are nocturnal and primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates such as insects, spiders, and even small vertebrates like birds or lizards. Their diet is aided by their unique set of teeth, which are actually fused to the jawbone, rather than being loose like those of most other reptiles. This structure allows them to grip and slice through the tough exoskeletons of their prey. Tuataras have a slow metabolism, which is characteristic of many reptiles, and they are capable of going without food for extended periods, sometimes for months, depending on the availability of food and environmental conditions.

The tuatara is particularly remarkable for its reproductive habits. They have a very slow rate of reproduction, with females typically only breeding every 2 to 5 years, a long interval compared to most other reptiles. The breeding season occurs during the warmer months, and males engage in territorial displays to attract females. The female lays between 6 and 15 eggs, which are incubated in burrows for up to 12 to 15 months—an unusually long incubation period for reptiles. The extended incubation is likely a result of the cool climate of New Zealand, which affects the developmental rate of the eggs. The hatchlings are relatively small and vulnerable when they first emerge, and they will spend their early years hiding in burrows to avoid predators.

Tuatara's survival is also threatened by climate change, as their slow metabolic rate and extended incubation period make them particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Warmer temperatures could disrupt their reproductive cycles and make the survival of hatchlings more difficult. Conservationists are working to protect tuataras by establishing breeding programs and ensuring the long-term stability of their habitats. Captive breeding efforts have been successful in raising awareness about the tuatara's plight and in preventing the species from becoming extinct."
Tufted Puffin,35-41,0.4-1,"Black, White",Up to 20,Carnivore,Coastal Areas,"Eagles, Falcons",17,North Pacific,Least Concern,Alcidae,122-130,17,Social groups,1,"The tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) is a striking seabird known for its distinctive appearance and vibrant plumage, native to the northern Pacific Ocean. This species of puffin is found along the coasts of Alaska, Canada, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest, as well as some parts of eastern Russia and Japan. The tufted puffin is a member of the auk family, which also includes other puffin species, murres, and guillemots. It is named for the distinctive tufts of golden-yellow feathers that grow behind its eyes, which are particularly prominent during the breeding season. These colorful feathers give the tufted puffin a unique and flamboyant appearance, making it one of the more easily recognizable seabirds.

Tufted puffins are medium-sized birds, with adults typically measuring about 14 to 15 inches (35 to 38 cm) in length and weighing between 400 and 600 grams (14 to 21 ounces). Their bodies are robust and compact, adapted for life in the water and air. They have a characteristic black and white plumage, with a dark black back, wings, and head, contrasted by a white face and underparts. Their most striking feature, however, is their large, brightly colored beak, which is orange with a pale blue base and a small ridge on the top. During the breeding season, the beak is even more vibrant, and the golden-yellow tufts on either side of the head add a dramatic flair.

Tufted puffins are excellent divers and are well adapted to life at sea. They spend most of their time in the ocean, diving to depths of up to 200 feet (60 meters) to catch fish, squid, and crustaceans. They use their wings to ""fly"" underwater, paddling through the water in much the same way that they fly through the air. When hunting, tufted puffins dive quickly and efficiently, using their sharp beaks to capture prey. Their diet consists primarily of small fish, like herring, capelin, and sand lance, as well as other marine invertebrates.

These seabirds are highly social and form large colonies, particularly on rocky islands and cliffs that provide both nesting sites and protection from predators. During the breeding season, tufted puffins create burrows in the ground or nest in crevices on steep cliffs, where they lay a single egg. Both parents share the responsibility of incubating the egg, which takes about 6 weeks to hatch. After hatching, the chick remains in the burrow for several weeks while both parents feed it, bringing fish and other food to the nest. As the chick grows, it is eventually able to leave the nest and take to the water to begin its independent life.

Tufted puffins are migratory and spend much of the year at sea, where they forage and socialize with other puffins and seabirds. They tend to return to their breeding colonies during the summer months, when the conditions are ideal for raising chicks. Outside of the breeding season, tufted puffins may travel long distances, sometimes migrating as far south as California or even further. They are often seen in large groups during migration, congregating in feeding areas where they can easily catch fish."
Uakari,46-56,03-Feb,"Bald, Red",15,Omnivore,Rainforests,"Jaguars, Snakes",20,Amazon Basin,Vulnerable,Pitheciidae,120-130,20,Group-based,06-Jan,"The uakari is a genus of primates native to the Amazon Rainforest in South America, known for their striking appearance and unique adaptations. There are two main species of uakari: the bald uakari (Cacajao calvus) and the red uakari (Cacajao novaesi), both of which belong to the family Atelidae, which also includes howler monkeys and spider monkeys. Uakaris are distinguished by their bright, bald faces, which are one of their most notable features. The bald uakari, in particular, has a red, hairless face, with a high forehead and a prominent, wrinkled appearance. This unusual facial feature, combined with their long, thick fur that ranges from dark brown to orange, makes them easily recognizable.

Uakaris are relatively small to medium-sized primates, with adult males typically weighing between 5 and 7 kilograms (11 to 15 pounds), while females are slightly smaller. They have long, bushy tails that are not prehensile but are used for balance when moving through the trees. Their limbs are also adapted for life in the canopy, with long arms and strong hands that enable them to grasp branches and navigate the dense rainforest. These monkeys are arboreal, meaning they spend the majority of their lives in the trees, rarely descending to the forest floor. Their long tails, strong limbs, and excellent leaping abilities allow them to move gracefully through the treetops in search of food and mates.

The uakari’s diet consists primarily of fruits, seeds, and nuts, but they also consume insects, leaves, and flowers. They are known to be selective feeders, preferring certain types of fruit and foraging in the upper levels of the forest where food sources are abundant. Uakaris have strong jaws and teeth that are well-suited for cracking open tough nuts and seeds. Their feeding habits can sometimes lead to the dispersal of seeds, which contributes to the regeneration of the rainforest. Due to their diet, uakaris play an important ecological role in their environment by helping to maintain the balance of plant species in their habitat.

Socially, uakaris are highly gregarious and live in small to medium-sized troops, which are often composed of between 10 and 30 individuals. These troops are typically led by an alpha male, although females often have significant influence in the social structure as well. Within these groups, uakaris communicate with each other using vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Their communication is complex, involving both social calls and alarm calls that help them coordinate activities or alert others to the presence of predators. The social dynamics of uakari troops are essential for the survival of the group, as they work together to find food and avoid danger. Uakaris are also known for their playful behavior and often engage in social grooming, which helps to strengthen bonds within the troop.

Reproduction in uakaris is typically seasonal, with mating occurring during the dry season when food is most plentiful. After a gestation period of around 160 days, females give birth to a single offspring, which is dependent on its mother for care and nourishment during the early stages of life. Young uakaris are born with soft, dark fur and gradually develop their characteristic bald face and red coloring as they mature."
Vampire Bat,Up to 9,Up to 0.05,Brown,12,Carnivore,"Caves, Forests","Hawks, Owls",24-40,Americas,Least Concern,Phyllostomidae,50-70,24-40,Colony-based,1,"Vampire bats, members of the subfamily Desmodontinae, are leaf-nosed bats currently found in Central and South America. Their food source is the blood of other animals, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three extant bat species feed solely on blood: the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi). Two extinct species of the genus Desmodus have been found in North America.

Unlike fruit bats, the vampire bats have short, conical muzzles. They also lack a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, also has specialized thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating areas where the blood flows close to the skin of its prey. A nucleus has been found in the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes.

A vampire bat has front teeth that are specialized for cutting and back teeth that are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, the part of the bat's brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source. Vampire bats also have a high level of resistance to a group of bloodborne viruses known as endogenous retroviruses, which insert copies of their genetic material into their host's genome.

Vampire bats tend to live in colonies in almost completely dark places, such as caves, old wells, hollow trees, and buildings. They range in Central to South America and live in arid to humid, tropical and subtropical areas. Vampire bat colony numbers can range from single digits to hundreds in roosting sites. The basic social structure of roosting bats is made of female groups and their offspring, a few adult males, known as ""resident males"", and a separate group of males, known as ""nonresident males"". In hairy-legged vampire bats, the hierarchical segregation of nonresident males appears less strict than in common vampire bats. Nonresident males are accepted into the harems when the ambient temperature lowers. This behavior suggests social thermoregulation.

Resident males mate with the females in their harems, and it is less common for outside males to copulate with the females. Vampire bats form strong bonds with other members of the colony. A related unique adaptation of vampire bats is the sharing of food. A vampire bat can only survive about two days without feeding, yet they cannot be guaranteed of finding food every night. This poses a problem, so when a bat fails to find food, it will often ""beg"" another bat for food. A ""donor"" bat may regurgitate a small amount of blood to sustain the other member of the colony. For equally familiar bats, the predictive capacity of reciprocity surpasses that of relatedness.

Vampire bats hunt only when it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and fish-eating bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds primarily on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed primarily on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground while on all fours. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then start to lick the area over and over again to make the place tender so it's easier to bite. Then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound. If there is fur on the skin of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7 mm wide and 8 mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them permanently razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts."
Vaquita,Up to 150,Up to 55,"Grey, White",20-21,Carnivore,Gulf of California,"Nets, Sharks",Not Applicable,"Gulf of California, Mexico",Critically Endangered,Phocoenidae,10-11 months,Not Applicable,Solitary,1,"The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is a species of porpoise endemic to the northern end of the Gulf of California in Baja California, Mexico. Reaching a maximum body length of 150 cm (4.9 ft) (females) or 140 cm (4.6 ft) (males), it is the smallest of all living cetaceans.

The smallest living species of cetacean, the vaquita can be easily distinguished from any other species in its range. It has a small body with an unusually tall triangular dorsal fin, a rounded head, and no distinguished beak. The coloration is mostly grey with a darker back and a white ventral field. Prominent black patches surround its lips and eyes. Sexual dimorphism is apparent in body size, with mature females being longer than males and having larger heads and wider flippers. Females reach a maximum size of about 150 cm (4.9 ft), while males reach about 140 cm (4.6 ft). Dorsal fin height is greater in males than in females. They are also known to weigh around 27 kg (60 lb) to 68 kg (150 lb). This makes them one of the smallest species in the porpoise family.

Vaquita habitat is restricted to a small portion of the upper Gulf of California (also called the Sea of Cortez), making this the smallest range of any cetacean species. They live in shallow, turbid waters of less than 150 m (490 ft) depth. Vaquitas are generalists, foraging on a variety of demersal fish species, crustaceans, and squids, though benthic fish such as grunts and croakers make up most of the diet.

Vaquitas are generally seen alone or in pairs, often with a calf, but have been observed in small groups of up to 10 individuals. Little is known about the life history of this species. Life expectancy is estimated at about 20 years and age of sexual maturity is somewhere between 3 and 6 years of age. While an initial analysis of stranded vaquitas estimated a two-year calving interval, recent sightings data suggest that vaquitas can reproduce annually. It is thought that vaquitas have a polygynous mating system in which males compete for females. This competition is evidenced by the presence of sexual dimorphism (females are larger than males), small group sizes, and large testes (accounting for nearly 3% of body mass).

The vaquita is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, which is only one level above being completely extinct in the wild. It is considered the most endangered marine mammal in the world. The vaquita has been listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 1996. The vaquita is at risk of extinction due to its small population size. It was approximated at one point that there were 150 individuals. In 2019, the UNESCO World Heritage Site where the last vaquita are located was classified as a World Heritage Site in Danger. For a small population such as the vaquita to recover after a severe decline in population size is very difficult. This conservation status is strongly influenced in part of the species reproductive biology. The large amount of unknown surrounding the key reproductive parameters of the vaquita makes understanding its potential for recovery even harder."
Vulture,Varies,Varies,"Black, Brown",Varies,Carnivore,Various,Not Applicable,Varies,"Africa, Asia, Americas",Varies,Accipitridae,Varies,Varies,Social groups,Varies,"A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion. There are 23 extant species of vulture (including condors). Old World vultures include 16 living species native to Europe, Africa, and Asia; New World vultures are restricted to North and South America and consist of seven identified species, all belonging to the Cathartidae family. A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald, unfeathered head. This bare skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding, and also plays an important role in thermoregulation.

Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold, and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat. They also urinate on themselves as a means of cooling their bodies. A group of vultures in flight is called a 'kettle', while the term 'committee' refers to a group of vultures resting on the ground or in trees. A group of vultures that are feeding is termed a 'wake'.

Vultures are scavengers, meaning that they eat dead animals. Outside of the oceans, vultures are the only known obligate scavengers. They rarely attack healthy animals, but may kill the wounded or sick. When a carcass has too thick a hide for its beak to open, it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first. Vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields. They gorge themselves when prey is abundant, until their crops bulge, and sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food. These birds do not carry food to their young in their talons but disgorge it from their crops. The mountain-dwelling bearded vulture is the only vertebrate to specialize in eating bones; it carries bones to the nest for the young, and hunts some live prey.

Vultures are of great value as scavengers, especially in hot regions. Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with botulinum toxin, hog cholera bacteria, and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers and remove these bacteria from the environment. New World vultures often vomit when threatened or approached. Contrary to some accounts, they do not ""projectile vomit"" on their attacker in defense, but to lighten their stomach load to ease take-off. The vomited meal residue may distract a predator, allowing the bird to escape.

Traditionally, vultures are known to bide their time, patiently observing from a distance or high in the sky as predators bring down their prey and commence feeding. Once these formidable predators have satiated their hunger and moved away from their kills, the vultures swoop in, making the most of the leftovers.

Vultures in south Asia, mainly in India and Nepal, have declined dramatically since the early 1990s. It has been found that this decline was caused by residues of the drug diclofenac in livestock carcasses. The government of India has taken very late cognizance of this fact and has banned the drug for animals. It may take decades for vultures to come back to their earlier population level, if ever. Without them to pick corpses clean, rabid dogs have multiplied, feeding on the carrion, and age-old practices like the sky burials of the Parsees are coming to an end, permanently reducing the supply of corpses. The same problem is also seen in Nepal where the government has taken some late steps to conserve the remaining vultures.

A recent study in 2016, reported that ""of the 22 vulture species, nine are critically endangered, three are endangered, four are near threatened, and six are least concern"". The conservation status of vultures is of particular concern to humans. For example, the decline of vulture populations can lead to increased disease transmission and resource damage, through increased populations of disease vector and pest animal populations that scavenge carcasses opportunistically. Vultures control these pests and disease vectors indirectly through competition for carcasses."
Walrus,Up to 3200,Up to 1200,Brown,40-50,Carnivore,"Arctic, Coastal Areas","Polar Bears, Orcas",40,"Arctic, Subarctic",Least Concern,Odobenidae,20-25,40,Group-based,Up to 200,"The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) is a large pinniped marine mammal with discontinuous distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is the only extant species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus. This species is subdivided into two subspecies: the Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus), which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens), which lives in the Pacific Ocean.

Adult walrus are characterised by prominent tusks and whiskers, and considerable bulk: adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds) and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. Walrus live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve molluscs. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and are considered to be a ""keystone species"" in the Arctic marine regions.

The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the northern shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska.

The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, priapulids, spoon worms, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks (such as snails, octopuses, and squid), some types of slow-moving fish, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction. The diet of the Pacific walrus consist almost exclusively of benthic invertebrates (97 percent).

Commercial harvesting reduced the population of the Pacific walrus to between 50,000 and 100,000 in the 1950s–1960s. Limits on commercial hunting allowed the population to increase to a peak in the 1970s-1980s, but subsequently, walrus numbers have again declined. Early aerial censuses of Pacific walrus conducted at five-year intervals between 1975 and 1985 estimated populations of above 220,000 in each of the three surveys.

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted it for meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walrus were widely hunted for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. It has rebounded somewhat since, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.

The effects of global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as ""least-concern"" by the IUCN, while the third is ""data deficient""."
Warthog,85-150,60-150,"Brown, Black",15-20,Omnivore,"Savannahs, Grasslands","Lions, Leopards",20,Sub-Saharan Africa,Least Concern,Suidae,160-220,20,Group-based,Apr-32,"The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild pig species native to sub-Saharan Africa, widely recognized for its distinctive appearance and behavior. Warthogs are medium-sized mammals that belong to the family Suidae, which also includes domestic pigs, wild boars, and other species of wild pigs. They are best known for their rugged, tough appearance, which is characterized by their large, protruding tusks, thick, coarse fur, and the ""warty"" bumps on their faces that give them their name. These warts are actually thickened skin and serve as a form of protection for the warthog during fights or encounters with predators, as they help absorb the impact of blows.

Adult warthogs typically weigh between 120 and 250 pounds (55 to 113 kilograms), with males being larger than females. Their bodies are stocky and muscular, designed for digging and running, while their legs are relatively short and strong. Warthogs have a broad head with large, curved tusks that are present in both males and females. The tusks grow throughout their lives and are used for digging, foraging, and in aggressive encounters with other warthogs or predators. The tusks are also used during mating rituals, where males often engage in displays of dominance. The tusks, particularly the larger ones of males, are a key feature that helps to distinguish warthogs from other pig species.

Warthogs are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, roots, fruits, and bark. They are opportunistic foragers and will also consume small invertebrates like insects if the opportunity arises. They have a highly developed sense of smell, which they use to locate food, and their strong digging abilities allow them to unearth roots and tubers from the ground. In addition to their diet, warthogs are also known to be very social animals, often found in small family groups that include females, their young, and occasionally a dominant male. These groups are highly structured, with the dominant male overseeing the group and mating with the females.

Warthogs are primarily active during the day, being most active in the early morning and late afternoon when the temperatures are cooler. During the hotter parts of the day, they seek shelter from the sun in burrows, often made by other animals such as aardvarks or other burrowing mammals. Warthogs are well adapted to life in the African savannas, and they can run surprisingly fast when threatened, reaching speeds of up to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour). When faced with a predator, warthogs tend to flee, running to the nearest available shelter, often diving headfirst into burrows to escape danger. They are also capable of running in a zigzag pattern to avoid being caught.

Socially, warthogs are known for their distinct and somewhat comical behavior. They often walk with their tails held high, giving the impression that they are in a state of alert, even though they are often quite relaxed. Their communication within the group includes grunts, snorts, and body language. Warthogs are highly adaptable and have been known to live in a variety of habitats, ranging from savannas and grasslands to open woodlands. Their ability to adapt to different environments and their foraging skills make them one of the most widespread wild pig species in Africa."
Water Buffalo,200-300,300-1200,Dark Gray,20-25,Herbivore,"Grasslands, Wetlands","Tigers, Crocodiles",40,"Asia, Africa",Least Concern,Bovidae,240-270,40,Group-based,30-500,"The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a large domesticated mammal native to Southeast Asia, although it has been introduced to many parts of the world for agricultural purposes. It is a member of the Bovidae family, closely related to the domestic cattle, and is known for its strength, endurance, and ability to thrive in wet, marshy environments. Water buffaloes are primarily used as draft animals, particularly in rice cultivation, and are also raised for their milk, meat, and hides. Over the centuries, they have played an essential role in the agricultural economies of many countries, especially in Asia, where they are regarded as symbols of wealth and productivity.

Water buffaloes have a distinctive appearance, characterized by their large, broad bodies, heavy musculature, and long, curved horns that can span up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length. Their thick skin, typically black or dark gray, is covered in short hair, and they have a hump over their shoulders, which gives them a robust and powerful look. Their legs are relatively short but strong, adapted for wading through water and mud. The buffalo’s wide hooves help it traverse wetlands and swampy terrain, making it well-suited for life in the marshes, where they often feed in the water. The horns of the water buffalo are one of its most notable features; in males, the horns are larger and more pronounced, often twisting and sweeping backward.

Water buffaloes are herbivores and graze on a wide variety of grasses, aquatic plants, and other vegetation. They are well-adapted to grazing in wetland environments, where they can feed on vegetation submerged in water. Water buffaloes are often seen wallowing in mud or immersing themselves in ponds and rivers, a behavior that helps them regulate their body temperature and protect their skin from insect bites and sunburn. The mud also acts as a natural sunscreen, which is especially important in the hot, humid climates where they are commonly found. Despite their large size, water buffaloes are relatively gentle animals, especially when domesticated, and they form strong bonds with their herders.

Socially, water buffaloes are herd animals, living in groups that can range from a few individuals to large, extended families. Herds are usually led by an older, dominant female, although in some cases, dominant males may also take charge. The herds are typically composed of females and their young, while adult males may either live alone or form bachelor groups. Communication within the herd is primarily through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. Water buffaloes are known for their calm, docile nature, although they can be protective of their young and may become aggressive if threatened. They use their horns for defense and to establish dominance within the group, especially during mating season when males compete for access to females.

Reproduction in water buffaloes typically occurs during the dry season, and females give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about 10 to 11 months. The calf is usually born in a sheltered area and is cared for by the mother, who nurses it for several months. Young buffaloes grow quickly and are able to join the herd in grazing and social activities after a few weeks. As they grow older, they become more independent, but they still rely on the protection and guidance of the herd. Water buffaloes can live for up to 25 years in the wild or in captivity, although many are put to work as draft animals long before reaching old age."
Western Gorilla,140-200,68-182,Black,30-40,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",40,Central Africa,Critically Endangered,Hominidae,220-270,40,Social groups,1,"The western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) is one of the two species of gorillas, the other being the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei). It is a critically endangered species native to the forests of central and western Africa, primarily found in countries like Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. Western gorillas are typically divided into two subspecies: the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), with the Cross River gorilla being the rarer and more isolated subspecies. Western gorillas are among the largest primates and are known for their strength, intelligence, and complex social structures.

Physically, western gorillas are large, robust animals with muscular builds, although they are smaller than their eastern counterparts. Adult males, known as silverbacks due to the silvery-gray hair on their backs, typically weigh between 300 and 485 pounds (140 to 220 kilograms), while females are generally smaller, weighing around 150 pounds (68 kilograms). They have broad, powerful shoulders, long arms that are about 1.5 times the length of their legs, and a deep chest. Their hands are large and capable of fine motor control, enabling them to manipulate objects, use tools, and forage effectively. The western gorilla’s face is expressive, with deep-set eyes, a broad nose, and strong jaw muscles. Their fur is dense, with a dark brown or black coloration, which helps them stay warm in the cool, wet environments of the rainforest.

Western gorillas are primarily herbivorous, with their diet consisting mainly of leaves, fruits, stems, roots, and bamboo. They are particularly fond of fruit, which makes up a significant portion of their diet, and they are also known to eat tree bark, vines, and occasionally ants or termites. Despite their size and strength, they are gentle creatures that typically move slowly and deliberately through the forest, foraging and eating for much of the day. Gorillas are non-territorial but are highly protective of their group, with dominant silverback males taking the lead in decisions about foraging locations and protecting the group from potential threats.

Socially, western gorillas live in groups known as troops, which are usually led by a single silverback male. These groups are made up of females, their offspring, and sometimes younger males, who may either remain with the group or leave when they mature. The silverback is the dominant male of the troop and serves as the leader, making decisions about where to forage, defending the group from predators or rival gorillas, and playing a key role in the group's social cohesion. Female gorillas tend to form strong bonds with their male silverback, and the troop generally consists of multiple generations. The social structure of western gorillas is based on cooperation and mutual support, with the young being cared for by the mothers and other females in the group. Infants are particularly dependent on their mothers, nursing for several months after birth and gradually becoming more independent as they grow.

Western gorillas are highly intelligent animals and exhibit complex behaviors. They are known to use tools in the wild, such as using sticks to test the depth of water or build nests for sleeping. They also have advanced communication skills, utilizing a wide range of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions to communicate with each other. These vocalizations can include grunts, roars, barks, and screams, often used in social interactions or to alert others to the presence of danger."
Western Lowland Gorilla,140-200,68-181,Black,30-40,Herbivore,Rainforests,"Leopards, Humans",40,Central Africa,Critically Endangered,Hominidae,220-270,40,Social groups,1,"The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is the most common subspecies of the western gorilla and is found primarily in the lowland rainforests and swampy areas of central and West Africa. These gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease, and their populations are steadily declining. The western lowland gorilla is distinguished by its robust build, large size, and distinctive facial features, and it shares many characteristics with other gorilla subspecies, including complex social structures and high intelligence.

Physically, western lowland gorillas are large, powerful primates with broad shoulders, long arms, and muscular bodies. Adult males, known as silverbacks due to the silvery-gray hair that appears on their backs as they mature, typically weigh between 300 to 485 pounds (140 to 220 kilograms), while females are considerably smaller, weighing around 150 pounds (68 kilograms). Their bodies are covered in coarse, dark fur, and they have wide, expressive faces with deep-set eyes, a prominent brow ridge, and large nostrils. Their arms are about 1.5 times the length of their legs, and they have opposable thumbs, which allows them to grasp objects, use tools, and manipulate their environment with impressive dexterity.

Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous and have a varied diet that includes leaves, fruits, stems, shoots, bark, and bamboo. They are particularly fond of fruits like bananas, guavas, and papayas, but they also consume a wide variety of plant material found in their tropical forest habitats. They have strong, efficient digestive systems that allow them to process a large quantity of plant matter each day. Despite their massive size, western lowland gorillas are relatively slow-moving animals and spend much of their time foraging and eating. They are often seen moving through the dense undergrowth of the forest, searching for food, and occasionally using tools to help them access difficult-to-reach food sources, like using sticks to rake leaves from high branches.

Socially, western lowland gorillas live in groups known as troops, which are typically led by a dominant male, known as a silverback. These groups are usually composed of females, their offspring, and sometimes younger males who have not yet left the group. The silverback male is the leader of the troop and plays a crucial role in decision-making, protecting the group from predators, and maintaining social harmony. The social structure of gorilla groups is generally peaceful, with females forming strong bonds with the silverback and each other. The dominant male is responsible for the safety and well-being of the group and is tasked with defending the troop against rival males or external threats.

Communication among western lowland gorillas is highly developed, with a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions used to convey messages within the group. They produce grunts, roars, barks, and screams to communicate with one another, especially during encounters with other groups or when there is a threat. Western lowland gorillas also use body language to express their emotions, including chest-beating, which is a sign of aggression or territorial display. Additionally, gorillas are known to make nests in trees or on the ground to sleep at night, and these nests are often carefully constructed using branches and leaves."
Whale Shark,Up to 1800,Up to 1500,"Gray, White",70-100,Filter Feeder,Oceans,Not Applicable,70,Worldwide,Endangered,Rhincodontidae,100-150,70,Solitary,1,"The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest living species of fish, known for its impressive size, gentle nature, and unique spotted pattern. Despite its name, the whale shark is not a mammal but a type of cartilaginous fish, specifically a member of the family Rhincodontidae. These majestic creatures inhabit warm, tropical, and subtropical oceans around the world, primarily in regions such as the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but they are also found in the Atlantic. Whale sharks are filter feeders, meaning they feed by swimming with their mouths open to filter plankton, small fish, and other microscopic organisms from the water.

The most striking feature of the whale shark is its sheer size. Adult whale sharks can reach lengths of up to 40 feet (12 meters) or more, with the largest verified individuals growing as long as 60 feet (18 meters). Their bodies are wide and flat, with a broad head and a large, terminal mouth located at the front of their face. Their skin is a dark gray or blue-gray, adorned with a distinctive pattern of light-colored spots and stripes. These markings are unique to each whale shark, similar to human fingerprints, and can be used by scientists to identify individual sharks for research and conservation purposes. The tail of the whale shark is large and crescent-shaped, helping it propel itself gracefully through the water.

Despite their enormous size, whale sharks are known for their gentle and docile nature. They are often seen slowly swimming near the surface of the water, where they can be observed by snorkelers and divers. Unlike many other large sharks, whale sharks pose no threat to humans, as their diet consists mainly of tiny organisms such as plankton, krill, and small fish. They filter these microscopic creatures through their gills by swimming with their mouths wide open, much like baleen whales. The whale shark’s feeding behavior is fascinating to watch, as it moves with its mouth open and takes in large volumes of water, using special structures in its gills called “gill rakers” to trap food. After filtering out the food, the water is expelled through the gills, and the shark continues its slow journey through the ocean.

Whale sharks are migratory creatures, traveling long distances across the oceans in search of food. They are often found in areas where plankton blooms occur, which attract large numbers of small fish and other marine life. Some of the most well-known feeding grounds for whale sharks are around coral reefs, islands, and coastal areas where nutrient-rich waters bring a high concentration of plankton. Whale sharks have been observed gathering in large numbers at certain times of the year, particularly during seasonal plankton blooms. One famous event takes place off the coast of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, where hundreds of whale sharks congregate in a feeding frenzy during the summer months. These seasonal aggregations provide researchers with valuable opportunities to study the species and monitor their populations.

Reproduction in whale sharks is not fully understood due to the difficulty of studying these creatures in the wild, but it is known that they are ovoviviparous, meaning that they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Female whale sharks have been found to carry hundreds of embryos at once, though the exact reproductive cycle is still unclear. It is believed that whale sharks give birth to pups in deeper, more secluded waters, and the young sharks grow at a slow pace. Whale sharks are thought to live for up to 100 years or more, though much of their life cycle remains a mystery. As filter feeders, they grow steadily over time, and their long lifespans may allow them to become the giants of the ocean."
White Rhinoceros,1400-2300,1800-2500,Gray,40-50,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Lions, Hyenas",45,Eastern and Southern Africa,Near Threatened,Rhinocerotidae,240-300,45,Group-based,14-Jan,"The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is the largest species of rhinoceros and one of the most iconic animals in Africa. Known for its broad, square-shaped mouth, the white rhino is a herbivorous mammal primarily found in the savannas and grasslands of southern and eastern Africa. There are two subspecies of white rhino: the southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum), which is the more common and widely distributed subspecies, and the critically endangered northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), which is on the brink of extinction. The white rhino plays a vital role in its ecosystem by grazing on grasses and helping to shape the landscape, maintaining open spaces that are beneficial for other species.

Physically, the white rhino is an impressive animal with a massive body, thick skin, and two prominent horns. The southern white rhino typically weighs between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds (1,400 to 2,300 kilograms), with males being larger than females. Their most distinguishing feature is their broad, square-shaped mouth, which is well-adapted for grazing on grasses. Unlike the more pointed lips of other rhinos, the white rhino’s wide mouth enables it to efficiently graze large amounts of grass. The skin of the white rhino is thick and tough, providing protection against the harsh African sun and predators. It is typically gray in color, though it may appear mud-stained, as the rhino often rolls in mud to keep cool and protect itself from insects. The rhino’s two horns, made of keratin (the same material as human hair and nails), are located on its snout, with the front horn being larger than the rear.

White rhinos are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses found in the savannas and open woodlands where they live. They have a relatively low metabolic rate, which allows them to survive on the large amounts of plant material they consume daily. Unlike other rhino species, which may browse on shrubs and trees, white rhinos are specialized grass feeders and prefer short, fresh grass. They graze in open areas, using their powerful jaws to clip the grass. White rhinos are not territorial, and males and females often roam the same areas, although males will defend a specific space or a group of females. They spend a significant amount of time feeding and resting, using their keen sense of smell to locate food and stay alert for potential threats.

Socially, white rhinos have a more relaxed structure compared to other rhino species. Females typically live in groups called crashes, which can consist of several related females and their offspring. Males, however, are more solitary and may establish a home range that overlaps with the territories of several females. While males do not form lasting bonds with other rhinos, they do interact with females during mating seasons. White rhinos communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, snorts, and growls, and they also use scent-marking behaviors to communicate with other rhinos. They have a keen sense of smell, which is critical for detecting other rhinos, predators, and food sources.

Reproduction in white rhinos is slow, with females typically giving birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about 16 to 18 months, one of the longest of any land mammal. Calves are born weighing around 60 to 100 pounds (27 to 45 kilograms) and are dependent on their mothers for protection and nourishment. The calf will stay with its mother for several years, gradually becoming more independent as it grows. White rhinos reach sexual maturity at about 6 to 7 years of age, but females typically do not give birth until they are older. The slow reproductive rate, combined with the threats posed by poaching and habitat loss, has contributed to the decline in white rhino populations, particularly the northern white rhino, which has seen its numbers dwindle to just a handful of individuals in recent years."
White Tiger,240-260,100-300,"White, Black Stripes",15,Carnivore,Rainforests,"Humans, Leopards",22,"India, Southeast Asia",Critically Endangered,Felidae,230-260,22,Solitary,1,"The white tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is a rare and visually striking variation of the Bengal tiger, characterized by its pale white coat with black stripes, pinkish nose, and bright blue eyes. While the white coloration is caused by a genetic mutation, it is not a separate subspecies of tiger but rather a rare color morph that occurs in Bengal tigers. The white tiger is not commonly found in the wild and is typically bred in captivity, where it has gained popularity in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. The mutation that causes the white coloration is a recessive gene, and both parent tigers must carry this gene for a white cub to be born. Despite their rarity and beauty, white tigers face several challenges, including genetic defects and ethical concerns surrounding their breeding in captivity.

Physically, white tigers are similar in size and shape to Bengal tigers, with adult males typically weighing between 400 to 500 pounds (180 to 225 kilograms) and measuring up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length from head to tail. Their white fur is due to a lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is responsible for the orange color in most tigers. Instead, they have a creamy white coat with black or dark brown stripes, which is distinct from the typical orange tigers but still provides camouflage in their natural habitats. The stripes of each white tiger are unique, and the contrast of the white coat against the dark stripes gives them a striking appearance. Their eyes, often a pale blue or green, further enhance their exotic look. Despite their beauty, the genetic mutation that results in the white coat can also lead to various health issues, including vision problems and physical deformities, which are often seen in white tigers bred in captivity.

White tigers, like their orange counterparts, are carnivorous apex predators. They primarily hunt large prey, such as deer, wild boar, and other mammals, in their native range in India and Southeast Asia. In the wild, their hunting skills are crucial for survival, as they rely on stealth and power to catch prey. They are solitary animals and generally prefer to hunt alone, using their keen senses of sight, smell, and hearing to track and ambush their quarry. White tigers are known to be skilled swimmers, and they often inhabit areas near rivers or swamps, where they can cool off and hunt aquatic animals as well. In captivity, their diet consists mainly of meat such as beef, chicken, and sometimes live prey for enrichment, although this is rare in modern zoos and wildlife sanctuaries.

Reproductive habits of white tigers are similar to those of Bengal tigers. Females typically give birth to litters of two to four cubs after a gestation period of about 93 to 112 days. However, breeding white tigers in captivity can be problematic, as the recessive gene for the white coat can cause inbreeding and genetic health issues. Many white tigers bred in captivity are the result of mating close relatives, which increases the risk of birth defects such as cleft palates, scoliosis (curved spines), and other physical problems. The high rates of inbreeding in some captive populations of white tigers have raised ethical concerns among conservationists and animal rights groups, leading to calls for responsible breeding practices and a greater emphasis on preserving the natural genetics of tigers.

In the wild, white tigers are extremely rare. While they have been historically found in certain parts of India, the chances of encountering a white tiger in its natural habitat are incredibly low. Most white tigers today exist only in zoos, wildlife parks, and private collections, where they are bred specifically for their unique coloration. The number of white tigers has been artificially increased through captive breeding programs, but the focus on producing white tigers for commercial purposes has contributed to the decline in the overall health and genetic diversity of the tiger population. In the wild, Bengal tigers, which have orange coats, are classified as endangered, with only a few thousand individuals left due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting the remaining tiger populations, and breeding white tigers in captivity does not contribute to these conservation goals."
Wild Boar,65-100,30-120,"Brown, Black",25,Omnivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Tigers, Leopards",20,"Eurasia, North Africa, Americas",Least Concern,Suidae,160-190,20,Group-based,30-Jun,"The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is a versatile and widespread species of pig native to Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa. It is considered the ancestor of the domestic pig and has adapted to a wide range of habitats, from temperate forests to grasslands and even mountainous areas. Wild boars have also been introduced to various regions around the world, where they have established populations, sometimes even becoming invasive species. Known for their resilience and ability to survive in diverse environments, wild boars are highly adaptable and have managed to thrive in areas modified by humans, often leading to conflicts with agriculture and local ecosystems.

Physically, wild boars are robust animals with a stocky build, muscular bodies, and thick fur. Their color varies, but it is typically a mix of brown, gray, or black, which helps them blend into their forested or grassy habitats. Adult males, or boars, are generally larger than females, with males weighing between 150 to 300 pounds (70 to 140 kilograms) and standing around 3 feet (90 cm) at the shoulder. Females, or sows, are usually smaller. One of the most distinctive features of wild boars is their tusks, which are elongated canine teeth that protrude from the lower jaw and continue to grow throughout their lives. These tusks are used for digging, foraging, and defending themselves, especially during fights with other males during the breeding season.

Wild boars are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders, eating a wide variety of foods, depending on what is available in their environment. Their diet includes roots, tubers, acorns, fruits, insects, small vertebrates, and even carrion. They are known for their powerful sense of smell, which they use to root through the ground in search of food. This behavior can cause significant damage to agricultural fields, as wild boars uproot crops like corn, wheat, and vegetables. In addition to their foraging skills, wild boars are also capable hunters, preying on small animals like birds, reptiles, and rodents when the opportunity arises. Their ability to adapt their diet to the seasons and their environment allows them to survive in a variety of habitats.

Socially, wild boars are generally solitary or live in small family groups. Sows typically form family units with their offspring, while males are more solitary, particularly after reaching adulthood. These family groups are matriarchal, with the mother being the leader. During the breeding season, males may engage in fights to compete for access to females. These encounters can be intense, with the males using their tusks to spar, often resulting in injuries. Wild boars are highly territorial and will mark their territory with scent glands located near their eyes. They are also known to be highly vocal, communicating with each other through grunts, growls, and squeals, especially in social interactions or when threatened.

Reproduction in wild boars is seasonal, with females typically giving birth in the spring or early summer after a gestation period of about 115 days. The average litter size is 4 to 6 piglets, although litters of up to 12 are not uncommon. Piglets are born with light brown or reddish-brown stripes that provide camouflage in their natural environment. They are highly dependent on their mothers in the early weeks of life, but as they grow, they begin to forage and explore their surroundings. Wild boar populations can increase rapidly due to their high reproductive rate, with females capable of breeding as early as 6 to 12 months of age. This prolific reproduction is one of the reasons why wild boars have been able to expand their range and establish populations in areas far from their native habitats."
Wildebeest,170-250,200-390,"Gray, Black",20-25,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Lions, Crocodiles",47,Eastern and Southern Africa,Least Concern,Bovidae,240-270,47,Group-based,1-1000,"The wildebeest, also known as the gnu, is a large herbivorous mammal found in Africa, primarily in the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. There are two main species of wildebeest: the black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) and the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). The blue wildebeest is more widespread and abundant, found in southern and eastern Africa, while the black wildebeest is primarily found in southern regions like South Africa. Wildebeests are known for their distinctive, robust bodies, broad shoulders, and unique facial features, including a long face, a broad nose, and large, curved horns that both males and females possess. These horns are a key characteristic used to identify wildebeests and serve a variety of purposes, including defense and display during mating season.

Wildebeests are large, powerful animals, with adult males of the blue wildebeest reaching weights of up to 600 pounds (270 kilograms) and females weighing slightly less. They stand about 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) tall at the shoulder. Their coat is typically dark brown or grayish with a lighter underbelly and a mane along their necks that extends down to their shoulders. The black wildebeest has a darker coat and a more striking white tail. Wildebeests are known for their strong legs and hooves, which allow them to move quickly across the plains and escape predators. Despite their bulky appearance, they are capable of fast running and long-distance migration, especially in response to seasonal changes in food availability.

Diet-wise, wildebeests are grazing animals that primarily feed on grasses. Their diet consists mainly of short grasses and forbs found in the savanna, and they play an important role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems by preventing overgrowth of vegetation. Wildebeests have a unique feeding behavior, often grazing in large herds and moving from one grazing area to another in search of fresh grass. This behavior is particularly important during the annual wildebeest migration, one of the largest mammal migrations in the world, where millions of wildebeests, along with zebras and gazelles, travel across the plains of East Africa, particularly in Tanzania and Kenya, to follow the rains and find new grazing grounds.

The wildebeest migration is one of the most iconic events in the animal kingdom. Every year, millions of wildebeests, along with other herbivores, undertake a seasonal journey that can cover hundreds of miles. This migration is driven by the availability of fresh grass after the rainy season, and it typically takes place in a circular pattern, moving from the Serengeti Plains in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya. The migration is fraught with dangers, as wildebeests face numerous predators, including lions, crocodiles, and hyenas, particularly when crossing rivers and navigating through predator-rich territories. The sheer size of the migration helps protect individuals, as they often travel in large herds, offering some safety in numbers. The migration is a crucial part of the wildebeest life cycle, providing them with the resources they need to survive and reproduce.

Reproduction in wildebeests follows a defined seasonal pattern, often coinciding with the start of the rainy season. Female wildebeests typically give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about eight and a half months. Calves are born in synchrony with the migration, ensuring that they are born during a period of ample food availability. At birth, calves are able to stand and walk within hours, which is essential for survival in the predator-rich environment. The calves are protected by the females, and the herd helps safeguard the young from predators. Wildebeests form strong social bonds, and their herds are often led by dominant males, which help protect the group and defend against threats."
Wolf,66-81,23-80,"Gray, White",13,Carnivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Bears, Humans",45,"Eurasia, North America, North Africa",Least Concern,Canidae,90-160,45,Group-based,20-Feb,"The wolf (Canis lupus) is a large carnivorous mammal that belongs to the Canidae family, making it closely related to domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes. Wolves are native to North America, Europe, and Asia, and they inhabit a wide variety of environments, including forests, tundra, grasslands, and even deserts. Wolves are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. They are highly social animals, living and hunting in packs, which are structured groups with clear hierarchies. Their packs typically consist of a breeding pair (the alpha male and female), their offspring, and sometimes other related wolves.

Physically, wolves are large and muscular animals, with adult males weighing between 70 to 110 pounds (32 to 50 kilograms) and standing around 26 to 32 inches (66 to 81 cm) at the shoulder. Females are generally smaller. Wolves have thick fur coats that help them survive in cold environments, with colors ranging from gray to white, brown, black, or a combination of these shades. Their fur provides insulation against the cold, and their long bushy tails help with balance and warmth. Wolves have sharp teeth and powerful jaws, which allow them to hunt and process large prey, including deer, moose, and smaller animals like rabbits and birds.

Wolves are carnivores and skilled hunters, relying on their pack structure to hunt in coordinated efforts. They typically hunt in groups to bring down larger prey, using strategy and teamwork. Their prey includes ungulates like deer, elk, and caribou, but wolves will also target smaller mammals when large prey is scarce. Wolves often engage in a technique called ""chase and tire,"" where they will follow and wear down their prey over long distances, using their stamina to exhaust the animal. Once the prey is weakened, wolves will work together to bring it down. In some regions, wolves also scavenge for food, often taking advantage of carcasses left by other predators.

The social structure of a wolf pack is highly organized, with each member of the pack playing a role in the survival of the group. The alpha pair leads the pack, with the alpha male typically taking charge of hunting and leading the pack, while the alpha female is responsible for reproduction. The rest of the pack members, including offspring from previous years, assist in hunting, guarding the territory, and caring for younger pups. The pack's size can vary from just a few wolves to over a dozen, depending on the availability of resources and the pack's territory. The cohesion and cooperation of the pack are essential to their survival, as wolves rely on each other for hunting success and protection from larger predators.

Reproduction in wolves typically occurs once a year, during the breeding season in late winter. After a gestation period of about 63 days, the alpha female gives birth to a litter of 4 to 7 pups, though larger litters are possible. The pups are born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mother for nourishment and warmth. Over the course of several weeks, the pups develop their senses, open their eyes, and begin to explore their surroundings. As they grow, they start to participate in pack activities, including learning to hunt. The pack plays a crucial role in raising the pups, with other members assisting in caring for them and teaching them essential survival skills."

Wombat,84-118,20-35,"Brown, Gray",10,Herbivore,"Forests, Grasslands","Dingoes, Tasmanian Devils",20,Australia,Least Concern,Vombatidae,126-138,20,Solitary,1,"Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials of the family Vombatidae that are native to Australia. Living species are about 1 m (40 in) in length with small, stubby tails and weigh between 20 and 35 kg (44 and 77 lb). They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of southern and eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated patch of about 300 ha (740 acres) in Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland.

Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws. One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backward pouch. The advantage of a backward-facing pouch is that when digging, the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young. Although mainly crepuscular and nocturnal, wombats may also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days. They are not commonly seen, but leave ample evidence of their passage, treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under.

Wombats leave distinctive cubic faeces. As wombats arrange these feces to mark territories and attract mates, it is believed that the cubic shape makes them more stackable and less likely to roll, which gives this shape a biological advantage. The method by which the wombat produces them is not well understood, but it is believed that the wombat intestine stretches preferentially at the walls, with two flexible and two stiff areas around its intestines. The adult wombat produces between 80 and 100, 2 cm (0.8 in) pieces of feces in a single night, and four to eight pieces each bowel movement.

All wombat teeth lack roots and are ever-growing, like the incisors of rodents. Wombats are herbivores; their diets consist mostly of grasses, sedges, herbs, bark, and roots. Their incisor teeth somewhat resemble those of rodents (rats, mice, etc.), being adapted for gnawing tough vegetation. Like many other herbivorous mammals, they have a large diastema between their incisors and the cheek teeth, which are relatively simple.

Male wombats have penile spines, a non-pendulous scrotum, and three pairs of bulbourethral glands. The testes, prostate, and bulbourethral glands enlarge during the breeding season. Female wombats give birth to a single young after a gestation period of roughly 20–30 days, which varies between species. All species have well-developed pouches, which the young leave after about six to seven months. Wombats are weaned after 15 months, and are sexually mature at 18 months. A group of wombats is known as a wisdom, a mob, or a colony.

Wombats have an extraordinarily slow metabolism, taking around 8 to 14 days to complete digestion, which aids their survival in arid conditions. They generally move slowly. Wombats defend home territories centred on their burrows, and they react aggressively to intruders. The common wombat occupies a range of up to 23 ha (57 acres), while the hairy-nosed species have much smaller ranges, of no more than 4 ha (10 acres).

Wombats are generally quiet animals. Bare-nosed wombats can make a number of different sounds, more than the hairy-nosed wombats. Wombats tend to be more vocal during mating season. When angered, they can make hissing sounds. Their call sounds somewhat like a pig's squeal. They can also make grunting noises, a low growl, a hoarse cough, and a clicking noise.

All species of wombats are protected in every Australian state. The biggest threats the species faces are its small population size, predation by wild dogs, competition for food because of overgrazing by cattle and sheep, and disease. Despite its name, the common wombat is no longer as common as it once was, and is under significant threat."

Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar and the extreme polar regions. Most species live in forests or woodland habitats, although a few species are known that live in treeless areas, such as rocky hillsides and deserts, and the Gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti.

Members of this family are chiefly known for their characteristic behaviour. They mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beaks, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, birds' eggs, small animals, tree sap, human scraps, and carrion. They usually nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with humans when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.

Woodpeckers include the tiny piculets, the smallest of which appears to be the bar-breasted piculet at 7.5 cm (3.0 in) in length and a weight of 8.9 g (0.31 oz). Some of the largest woodpeckers can be more than 50 cm (20 in) in length. The largest surviving species is the great slaty woodpecker, which weighs 430 g (15 oz) on average and up to 563 g (19.9 oz), and measures 45 to 55 cm (18 to 22 in), but the extinct imperial woodpecker, at 55 to 61 cm (22 to 24 in), and ivory-billed woodpecker, around 48 to 53 cm (19 to 21 in) and 516 g (18.2 oz), were probably both larger.

Overall, woodpeckers are arboreal birds of wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur in almost all suitable habitats, including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where a small number of trees exist, or in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodlands, or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards, and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.

Most woodpeckers live solitary lives, but their behavior ranges from highly antisocial species that are aggressive towards their own kind, to species that live in groups. Solitary species defend such feeding resources as a termite colony or fruit-laden tree, driving away other conspecifics and returning frequently until the resource is exhausted. Aggressive behaviors include bill pointing and jabbing, head shaking, wing flicking, chasing, drumming, and vocalizations. Ritual actions do not usually result in contact, and birds may ""freeze"" for a while before they resume their dispute. The colored patches may be flouted, and in some instances, these antagonistic behaviors resemble courtship rituals.

The Picidae are one of nine living families in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets (comprising three families), toucans, toucan-barbets, and honeyguides, which (along with woodpeckers) comprise the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two possibly being so."
Woolly Mammoth,Up to 4200,Up to 12000,"Brown, Shaggy",Varies,Herbivore,Tundra,Not Applicable,Varies,Northern Hemisphere,"Extinct (around 4,000 years ago)",Elephantidae,Varies,Varies,Social groups,Varies,"The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived from the Middle Pleistocene until its extinction in the Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with the African Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 years ago in Siberia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) lived alongside the woolly mammoth in North America, and DNA studies show that the two hybridised with each other. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.

The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North America, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.67 and 3.49 m (8 ft 9 in and 11 ft 5 in) and weighed between 3.9 and 8.2 t (3.8 and 8.1 long tons; 4.3 and 9.0 short tons). Females reached 2.3–2.6 m (7 ft 7 in – 8 ft 6 in) in shoulder heights and weighed between 2.8–4 t (2.8–3.9 long tons; 3.1–4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kg (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environments present during glacial periods, including the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.

The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and hunted the species for food. The population of woolly mammoths declined at the end of the Late Pleistocene, with the last populations on mainland Siberia persisting until around 10,000 years ago, although isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. The completion of the mammoth genome project in 2015 sparked discussion about potentially reviving the woolly mammoth through several various methods. However, none of these approaches are currently feasible."
Yak,140-160,500-1200,"Brown, Black",20-25,Herbivore,Mountains,"Snow Leopards, Wolves",24,"Himalayas, Central Asia",Least Concern,Bovidae,215-280,24,Group-based,Oct-50,"The yak (Bos grunniens), also known as the Tartary ox, grunting ox, hairy cattle, or domestic yak, is a species of long-haired domesticated cattle found throughout the Himalayan region of Gilgit-Baltistan (Kashmir, Pakistan), Nepal, Sikkim (India), the Tibetan Plateau (China), Tajikistan and as far north as Mongolia and Siberia. It is descended from the wild yak (Bos mutus).

Yaks are heavily built animals with bulky frames, sturdy legs, rounded, cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur hanging lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable, often having rusty brown and cream patches. They have small ears and broad foreheads, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour. In males (bulls), the horns sweep out from the sides of the head and then curve backwards; they typically range from 48 to 99 cm (19 to 39 in) in length. The horns of females (cows) are smaller, at 27 to 64 cm (11 to 25 in) in length, and have a more upright shape. Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, although this is larger and more visible in males. Males weigh 350 to 585 kg (772 to 1,290 lb), females weigh 225 to 255 kg (496 to 562 lb). Wild (feral) yaks can be substantially heavier, bulls reaching weights of up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). Depending on the breed, domestic yak males are 111–138 cm (44–54 in) high at the withers, while females are 105–117 cm (41–46 in) high at the withers.

Yak physiology is well adapted to high altitudes, having larger lungs and heart than cattle found at lower altitudes, as well as greater capacity for transporting oxygen through their blood, due to the persistence of foetal haemoglobin throughout life. Conversely, yaks have trouble thriving at lower altitudes, and are prone to suffering from heat exhaustion above about 15 °C (59 °F). Further adaptations to the cold include a thick layer of subcutaneous fat and an almost complete lack of functional sweat glands.

Yaks mate in the summer, typically between July and September, depending on the local environment. For the remainder of the year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds. Still, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight with each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung.

In parts of Tibet and Karakorum, yak racing is a form of entertainment at traditional festivals and an important part of their culture. More recently, sports involving domesticated yaks, such as yak skiing or yak polo, are being marketed as tourist attractions in South Asian countries, including in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. In Nepal, an annual festival is held to drink the fresh blood of yak, and it is believed that it cures various diseases such as gastritis, jaundice, and body strain. The fresh blood is extracted from the neck of a yak without killing it. The cut is healed after the ceremony is over. The ritual is believed to be originated in Tibet and Mustang."
Yellow-Eyed Penguin,60-65,03-Jan,"Yellow, White",Up to 20,Carnivore,Coastal Areas,"Seals, Orcas",25,New Zealand,Endangered,Spheniscidae,80-90,25,Solitary,1,"The yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), known also as hoiho, is a species of penguin endemic to New Zealand. It is the sole extant species in the genus Megadyptes. Previously thought closely related to the little penguin (Eudyptula minor), molecular research has shown it more closely related to penguins of the genus Eudyptes. Like most penguins, it is mainly piscivorous.

The species breeds along the eastern and south-eastern coastlines of the South Island of New Zealand, as well as Stewart Island / Rakiura, Auckland Islands, and Campbell Islands. Colonies on the Otago Peninsula are a popular tourist venue, where visitors may closely observe penguins from hides, trenches, or tunnels. On the New Zealand mainland, the species has experienced a significant decline over the past 20 years. On the Otago Peninsula, numbers have dropped by 75% since the mid-1990s and population trends indicate the possibility of local extinction in the next 20 to 40 years. While the effect of rising ocean temperatures is still being studied, an infectious outbreak in the mid-2000s played a large role in the drop. Human activities at sea (fisheries, pollution) may have an equal if not greater influence on the species' downward trend.

The yellow-eyed penguin (M. a. antipodes) is most easily identified by the band of pale yellow feathers surrounding its eyes and encircling the back of its head. Its forehead, crown and the sides of its face are slate grey flecked with golden yellow. Its eye is yellow. The foreneck and sides of the head are light brown. The back and tail are slate blue-black. Its chest, stomach, thighs and the underside of its flippers are white in colour. Juvenile birds have a greyer head with no yellow band around their eyes.

It is the largest living penguin to breed on the mainland of New Zealand and the fourth or fifth heaviest living penguin by body mass. It stands 62–79 centimetres (24–31 in) tall and weighs 3–8.5 kilograms (6.6–18.7 lb). Weight varies throughout the year, with penguins being heaviest just before moulting, during which they may lose 3–4 kilograms in weight. Males at around 5.53 kg (12.2 lb) on average are somewhat heavier than females at an average of 5.13 kg (11.3 lb). The yellow-eyed penguin may be long lived, with some individuals reaching 20 years of age. Males are generally longer lived than females, leading to a sex ratio of 2:1 around the age of 10–12 years. The yellow-eyed penguin is mostly silent.[2] It makes a shrill bray-like call at nest and breeding sites.

The yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as being endangered. It was first included on the list in 1988 when it was listed as threatened. Its status has since been changed to endangered in the year 2000. It had an estimated population of 4000 in 2007. The main threats include habitat degradation and introduced predators. It may be the most ancient of all living penguins. In August 2010, the yellow-eyed penguin was granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act."
Yeti Crab,Up to 15,Up to 0.5,"White, Hairy",Up to 20,Omnivore,Hydrothermal Vents,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Pacific Ocean,Not Evaluated,Kiwaidae,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Solitary,Not Applicable,"Kiwa hirsuta is a crustacean discovered in 2005 in the South Pacific Ocean. This decapod, which is approximately 15 cm (5.9 in) long, is notable for the quantity of silky blond setae (resembling fur) covering its pereiopods (thoracic legs, including claws). Its discoverers dubbed it the ""yeti lobster"" or ""yeti crab"". Macpherson et al. named the genus Kiwa after ""the god(dess) of the shellfish in the Polynesian mythology."" Hirsuta is Latin for ""hairy.""

The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack pigment, and is thought to be blind. The ""hairy"" pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. This process is known as chemosynthesis. Lipid and isotope analyses provide evidence that epibiotic bacteria are the crab's main food source and K. puravida has highly modified setae (hairs) on its 3rd maxilliped (a mouth appendage) which it uses to harvest these bacteria. Yeti crabs receive most of their essential nutrients from chemosynthetic episymbiotic bacteria which grows on hairlike setae. This chemosynthetic episymbiotic bacteria can be found growing from numerous areas of their ventral surface as well as their appendages. The ε- and γ- proteobacteria that this methane-deep species farms are closely related to hydrothermal-vent decapod epibionts. Alternatively, it may be a carnivore, although it is generally thought to feed on bacteria.

Although it is often referred to as the ""furry lobster"" outside the scientific literature, Kiwa hirsuta is a squat lobster, more closely related to crabs and hermit crabs than true lobsters. The term ""furry lobster"" is more commonly used for the family Synaxidae. The ""yeti crab"" was found in a recently discovered family called the Kiwaidae. This family is closely associated with the two families, Epsilon and Gammaproteobacteria. Kiwa hirsuta exhibits a unique reproductive strategy. Unlike many other crustaceans, the females of this species carry their eggs in a specialized brooding structure on their abdomen. The eggs are attached to setae, and the female cares for them until they hatch into larvae. This method of parental care is distinctive among deep-sea organisms.

Studies on the population dynamics of Kiwa hirsuta are ongoing to understand factors such as population size, growth rates, and potential threats to its habitat. Conservation efforts are also being explored to mitigate the impact of deep-sea mining and other human activities on the hydrothermal vent ecosystems where these crabs reside.

Genomic studies of Kiwa hirsuta have provided insights into its evolutionary history and adaptation to the extreme environment of hydrothermal vents. The analysis of its genome may offer clues about the genetic basis of its unique characteristics, such as the adaptation to low-light conditions and the utilization of chemosynthetic bacteria for nutrition. Observations of Kiwa hirsuta in its natural habitat have provided valuable information about its behavior. For example, researchers have documented interactions between individuals, including potential mating behaviors and social dynamics within populations living around hydrothermal vents."
Zebra,220-340,400-900,"Black, White",20-25,Herbivore,Grasslands,"Lions, Hyenas",25,Africa,Least Concern,Equidae,180-365,25,Group-based,20-May,"Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.

Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions, and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.

Zebras' dazzling stripes make them among the most recognizable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been completely domesticated. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists Grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga (E. quagga quagga), a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.

Zebras may travel or migrate to wetter areas during the dry season. Plains zebras have been recorded travelling 500 km (310 mi) between Namibia and Botswana, the longest land migration of mammals in Africa. When migrating, they appear to rely on some memory of the locations where foraging conditions were best and may predict conditions months after their arrival. Zebras sleep for seven hours a day, standing up during the day and lying down during the night. They regularly use various objects as rubbing posts and will roll on the ground.

Important areas for Grévy's zebra include Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary and Chelbi Sanctuary in Ethiopia and Buffalo Springs, Samburu and Shaba National Reserves in Kenya. The plains zebra inhabits the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, Tsavo and Masai Mara in Kenya, Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, Etosha National Park in Namibia, and Kruger National Park in South Africa. Mountain zebras are protected in Mountain Zebra National Park, Karoo National Park and Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa as well as Etosha and Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia."
Zebra Shark,Up to 330,Up to 32,"Brown, Yellowish",25-30,Carnivore,Coral Reefs,Larger Fish,20,Indo-Pacific region,Endangered,Stegostomatidae,25-Oct,20,Solitary,Up to 25,"The zebra shark (Stegostoma tigrinum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62 m (203 ft). Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and usually a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under 50–90 cm (20–35 in) long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges. This species attains a length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft).

Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.

The zebra shark occurs in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (including Madagascar and the Maldives), to India and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palau), northward to Taiwan and Japan, eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga, and southward to northern Australia. Bottom-dwelling in nature, the zebra shark is found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 62 m (203 ft) over the continental and insular shelves. Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. 

During the day, zebra sharks are sluggish and usually found resting on the sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop up the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.

The zebra shark feeds primarily on shelled molluscs, though it also takes crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey."
